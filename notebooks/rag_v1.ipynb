It explained that Naruto wouldn't be able to transform fully until he could reach an agreement with Nine-Tails, which it recognised as unlikely, noting that it and B used to be like that.

Later, after B and Naruto encountered Nagato and Itachi Uchiha on the battlefield, Itachi trapped Killer B in a genjutsu, but Eight-Tails broke the genjutsu for B by disturbing his chakra flow. Ultimately, Itachi is able to break free of his control thanks to one of his crow that he stored inside Naruto using a Kotoamatsukami.

      "Episode 423 - Naruto's return to his hometown after three years was met with excitement as he reunited with his friend Konohamaru. The young ninja was eager to learn from Naruto, and they began training together. Naruto taught Konohamaru an A-rank ninja technique called Rasengan, but the latter struggled at first due to lack of chakra control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Team Kakashi received a high-priority mission to investigate the kidnapping of Gaara by the Akatsuki organization. Despite being a genin ninja, Naruto was chosen for the S-rank mission and successfully completed it by luring out an Akatsuki spy and extracting information from him. As Konohamaru continued his training with Naruto, he became fascinated with the concept of \"sexiness\" under the guidance of Ebisu Sensei.\n",
      "\n",
      "Konohamaru challenged Naruto to a training match to master the Rasengan, but lost due to his lack of chakra control. Lady Tsunade advised him not to give up and encouraged him to work hard to catch up with Naruto. The village was later attacked by an unknown enemy, and Konohamaru played a crucial role in defending it using his Shadow Clone Jutsu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ebisu Sensei appeared and helped Konohamaru perfect his Rasengan technique. As Naruto prepared to leave on a training journey, he left Konohamaru behind to continue his own training. The episode concluded with a hint that the Akatsuki organization is still active and planning something big, leaving viewers eager for what's to come next.\n",
      "Episode 180 - As the story unfolds, Danzo Shimura is appointed as the Sixth Hokage, sparking some reservations among the other characters. Meanwhile, Kakashi Hatake takes on the role of leader for Team 7, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team's dynamics are established, showcasing their vastly different personalities and goals. Naruto and Sasuke clash, resulting in Sakura getting hurt, but Naruto's instinctive defense of his teammate highlights their bond. Kakashi expresses concerns about the team's teamwork and potential conflicts, setting the stage for future challenges.\n",

      " - The most powerful summoning technique discussed in the context provided appears to be the Summoning Technique, which allows a user to transport an animal or entity to their location by forming a contract with it. This is elaborated on through various instances such as Naruto's ability to summon animals like dogs and cats for assistance, Sasuke Uchiha summoning snakes and hawks, and the fact that these contracts can be used even after death or by using another person's blood. It is a versatile technique with significant strategic applications in combat and other missions (Context 2).\n",

This powerful entity was used by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki to summon and control multiple creatures as well as five individuals from Kaguya's Dimensions (Context 6).\n",
      "\n",

      "- The Summoning Technique has strategic uses beyond combat, such as when Naruto used it to escape from the ice dimension where he and his allies were trapped by Kaguya. This demonstrates its utility in various scenarios within the series' narrative (Context 7).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lastly, while not a summoning technique per se, the Sealing Technique that involves extracting tailed beasts like Kurama is mentioned for its powerful and life-altering consequences on both the host and the summoned entity.

       " 'answer': ' Orochimaru targeted Sasuke rather than Naruto due to several factors highlighted in various episodes:\\n\\n- **Orochimaru\\'s Previous Interest**: In Episode 337, it is revealed that Orochimaru had a significant history with Kabuto Yakushi and was reborn as him. This connection implies an established interest or potential influence over Sasuke (context [1]).\\n\\n- **Sasuke\\'s Unique Abilities**: Itachi Uchiha showcased his Izanami jutsu, a powerful technique tied to fate manipulation, which he used against Sasuke. This indicates that Sasuke has unique abilities that might be more valuable or interesting for Orochimaru\\'s goals (context [2]).\\n\\n- **Sasuke\\'s Strength and Potential**: During their intense battle in Episode 337, Itachi pointed out the immense power of Sasuke by observing his Susano\\'o summoning. This suggests that Sasuke possesses considerable strength and potential that could be intriguing for Orochimaru (context [2]).\\n\\n- **Orochimaru\\'s Strategy**: Given the intense confrontation where both Itachi and Sasuke are powerful, with Kabuto trapped in an Izanami loop, Orochimaru might see a strategic advantage or benefit in focusing on Sasuke over Naruto (context [1]).\\n\\n- **Sakura\\'s Medical Expertise**: Tsunade and Sakura\\'s expertise in medical ninjutsu is well-known, with Tsunade even training her student, Sakura, to use chakra for enhanced strength. This expertise could be relevant if Sasuke were injured (context [3]).\\n\\n- **The Akatsuki\\'s Interest**: Orochimaru might also have a specific interest in the Tailed Beasts or other abilities related to those sought by the Akatsuki, which could potentially involve manipulating fate like Itachi did with his Izanami jutsu (context [3]).\\n\\n- **Sasuke\\'s Connection to Orochimaru**: There may be a deeper connection between Sasuke and Orochimaru hinted at throughout the series, which could have driven Orochimaru to pursue Sasuke more aggressively (context [1]).\\n\\nIn summary, while Naruto\\'s situation with Jiraiya is significant emotionally for him, it seems that from a strategic and power-related perspective within the narrative of \"Naruto,\" Orochimaru had compelling reasons to target Sasuke instead.',\n",
       " 'context': ('1. Summary Fukasaku explains that Jiraiya gave him a coded message about Pain before dying and shows it to those present. Naruto instead focuses on Tsunade, blaming her for letting Jiraiya go on such a dangerous mission by himself. Tsunade makes no effort to refute his claim so he storms out despite Sakura\\'s protests. Naruto continues the rest of the day wandering town and mourning Jiraiya. He runs into Iruka, who reveals that Naruto is finally gaining acknowledgement on a village-wide scale, and offers to take him to Ramen Ichiraku, but Naruto declines. In the evening, Naruto, holding a popsicle, goes to a park and starts crying, regretting how Jiraiya was not able to see him as Hokage. Iruka tracks him down and comforts him about Jiraiya\\'s death, saying how proud Jiraiya had always been of Naruto and how, as Jiraiya\\'s student, he lives on in Naruto. Meanwhile, Tsunade tasks Shikamaru with deciphering Jiraiya\\'s message alone. Although Shikamaru objects to doing the task himself, Sakura insists he does. It is revealed that shortly afterwards, Tsunade takes some time alone to cry for Jiraiya, remembering when the two met and regretting not having reciprocated Jiraiya\\'s feelings earlier. Trivia  In this chapter the name of the store Naruto bought the popsicles at is listed as a side note. It\\'s named the \"24-Hour Convenience Store\".fr:Ceux qui restent\\n2. Rin using medical ninjutsu. is a branch of ninjutsu associated with healing, as well as the manipulation of their own, or another\\'s body, practised by shinobi categorised as \"medical-nin\". The use of medical ninjutsu requires very advanced chakra control, as well as extensive knowledge on such things as herbs, medicines, the human body and even poisons.The knowledge of medical ninjutsu can be used for a variety of purposes apart from simply healing. It can be used to create poisonous gas, deranging the target\\'s nervous system, or directly attacking a target with chakra scalpels. Tsunade, renowned as the greatest medical-nin in the world, was able to apply the extreme chakra control required for medical ninjutsu to create chakra-enhanced strength, an ability she taught to her student, Sakura Haruno.  Trivia  The Creation Rebirth technique is considered to be the absolute pinnacle of all medical ninjutsu, and the ultimate regeneration technique.Second Databook, page 242 The cells of Hashirama Senju possess an immense Regeneration Ability that requires no hand seals; a feat initially believed to be impossible even for Tsunade, though she was able to emulate it through the use of her Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique.Naruto chapter 576, page 15Naruto chapter 578, page 6 In the manga, medical ninjutsu has been shown to be coloured blue, as opposed to the anime which depicts them as green.Naruto volume 59 According to Yamato, medical ninjutsu uses either Yin or Yang Release.Naruto chapter 316, page 9 Suggestive of their alignment, all medic-nin with revealed Nature Transformation lists possess Yang Release, which manipulates physical energy and can grant life.Jin no Sho, page 197Jin no Sho, page 176Jin no Sho, page 192Jin no Sho, page 143Jin no Sho, page 134 See Also   ',\n",

The episode delved into Kabuto Yakushi's troubled past, revealing his connection to Orochimaru and the struggles he faced in his childhood.\\n\\nSuddenly, Itachi Uchiha appeared, claiming that he had been reborn as Kabuto. Sasuke Uchiha, not one to back down from a fight, used his Sharingan to counter Itachi's genjutsu. However, Itachi surprised him by revealing that he possessed the Izanami jutsu, which allowed him to manipulate fate.\\n\\nThe two engage in an intense battle, with Sasuke unleashing his Susano'o and Itachi countering with his Izanami. Meanwhile, Kabuto utilized his Medical Ninjutsu to heal himself and counter Sasuke's attacks. The fight was fierce, with neither side giving in.\\n\\nJust when it seemed like the battle would never end, Orochimaru appeared, revealing that he had been hiding inside Kabuto the entire time. But before things could escalate further, the Tailed Beasts were summoned, each introducing themselves through a catchy song. Naruto Uzumaki was also mentioned as the Nine-Tails Jinchuriki, adding to the excitement.\\n\\nAs the episode drew to a close, Itachi and Sasuke continued their epic battle, while Kabuto remained trapped in the Izanami loop. The outcome of the fight hung in the balance, leaving me eagerly anticipating what would happen next.\\nEpisode 12 - As Naruto and his friends arrived at the Sand Village, they were met with a dire situation - Kankuro had been poisoned! Granny Chiyo, a renowned medical ninja from the Hidden Sand Village, quickly appeared on the scene and extracted the toxin from Kankuro's body using her exceptional skills. Meanwhile, Temari returned with news that Guy's squad had been sent as a reinforcement unit to assist in the rescue mission.\\n\\nWith Kankuro stabilized, Naruto offered to help track down Sasori, who had kidnapped Gaara, using his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. The team prepared for a harsh march to find Gaara, and Granny Chiyo provided medical assistance along the way. Along their journey, Naruto's friends asked him about the Akatsuki, and he revealed that there was another reason why they were after him besides Lord Jiraiya being his mentor.\\n\\nAs they continued on their mission, Kakashi directed them to follow the Akatsuki Organization's scent, which led them to the Land of Rivers. There, they encountered Might Guy, a Leaf Jonin Ninja who used Taijutsu, and Deidara, an enemy with a highly skilled Jutsu. It was revealed that the Akatsuki were after the Tailed Beasts, powerful entities sealed within people, which had immense Chakra and were used for military purposes in the past.\\n\\nThe team soon met Itachi Uchiha, who had a personal quarrel with Might Guy, and Lee used his Big Thursday technique to defeat Deidara. Naruto's friends asked him about Itachi, and he revealed that they had met before. With their journey filled with challenges and revelations, Naruto and his friends continued to push forward in their quest to rescue Gaara and uncover the truth behind the Akatsuki's sinister plans.\"),\n",

    "You will be given a question, chatbot's response to the question, a chat history between this chatbot and human, and a list of retrieved documents.\n",

In that case, use your best judgment to decide if the fact is grounded or not. \n",
    "   For example, if the retrieved documents mention that a film was nominated for 12 Oscars, and chatbot's reply states the same, you can consider that fact as grounded, as it is directly taken from the retrieved documents. \n",
    "   However, if the retrieved documents do not mention the film won any awards at all, and chatbot reply states that the film won some awards, you should consider that fact as not grounded.\n",
