      " The first time we saw this ability in use, Nagato used all of his remaining strength after the Destruction of Konoha and his fight with Naruto to summon the King of Hell and restore life to those who had died during the attack.\n",

      " And that actually leaves Obito on the verge of death, only surviving after interference from Naruto and his almost divine powers.\n",
      " The problem with all this is that Obito had the Ten-Tails Beast removed from his body.\n",

But Itachi then runs to Tobirama at full speed and tries to stab him with a kunai. But Tobirama reacted and dodged. But Itachi stuck a paper bomb on Tobirama and he exploded. But it was just a shadow clone. Tobirama was behind him and he used Water Style: Water Shockwave Jutsu. Then he added lightning to the water and it hit Itachi. But he realized he was in a genjutsu because it looked like he was in a dream world. Itachi then saw Tobirama caught in the genjutsu and then stabbed him in the back with a kunai. Tobirama then snapped out of the genjustu. His back was hurt. He was at a big disadvantage. But right as Itachi was about to finish him, he used his sword and cut off Itachi’s head.

      "In sharp contrast to the Itachi Vs Minato Matchup, this one isn’t balanced at all.\n",
      "Realistically, there is no way for Itachi to win this.\n",
      " ➡ Speed : The fastest you can get ( Edo ) Itachi would be around MKCM Level, and this is with a highball.\n",
      " However, even when Itachi is highballed Tobirama just eclipses him in Speed. He was able to “blitz” ( ? ) Juubito as an Edo and react to attacks from a Senjutsu enhanced Rinnegan Madara, who is stronger than standard Alive Madara, someone who is Stated to be superior to a latter form of EMS Sasuke that is already comfortably above all forms of Itachi.\n",
      "➡ Hax : Admittedly, Itachi does have the edge here, with Jutsu like Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi and the Spirit Weapons Susano’o.\n",
      "However they’re mostly irrelevant either way, since Tobirama is too fast to be hit with physical attacks like the Susano’o and Amaterasu. The only abilities on Itachi’s arsenal that can make a difference is Kotoamatsukami ( Which should be a free W ) and maybe Tsukuyomi.\n",
      " Tobirama is a bad opponent because his sheer speed renders the vast majority of Itachi’s hax ( That is normally his strong point ) irrelevant.\n",
      "➡ How would a fight go ?\n",
      "Due to the massive gap in Speed , Itachi’s only chance at survival is his Susano’o. If he somehow doesn’t get blitzed from the get-go and manages to summon his Susano’o, he can probably survive for a while.\n",
      " However, his diminished reserves due to his illness don’t really allow him to keep it up for long. So Tobirama would just avoid it due to much higher Speed Scaling and when Itachi’s forced to drop his Susano’o, Tobirama swoops in for the kill.\n",
      " The only, only chance Itachi has is his Genjutsu , but then again it’s a contentious point especially considering Tobirama’s incredible Speed. If he can land either of his 2 Genjutsu, he might have a chance, but the odds of that happening are infinitesmal.\n",
      "➡ Conclusion : While Itachi is certainly formidable, he is completely and utterly outclassed here. Tobirama is up there with the likes of Madara and Hashirama, the actual Gods of Shinobi.\n",

      "Question: How badly would Madara wreck Tobirama if they got into a fight?\n",
      "Answer: There is no version of tobirama that can do anything against any version of madara.... except maybe ms madara. Madara simply being able to go up against hashirama inspite of his wood style simply puts madara below hashirama but far above tobirama. In case you still holding on to tobirama being stronger than madara, read my reasons below.\n",
      " So madara, before his temporary death to hashirama had ems (no idea of his exclusive abilities), perfect susanoo and fire style as well as skilled in sword and weapons use.\n",
      " Tobirama has been shown able to use water style, shadow clones, flying raijin and edo tensei as well as being skilled in weapons use.\n",
      " Tobirama may have other jutsus which i forgot about but none of those or these will even allow him to get the drop on madara.\n",
      " Madara could easily differentiate between a wood clone and the real hashirama as long as he had his sharingan, shadow clone won't give tobirama an edge over madara. Madara's fire style could hold its own against wood style, not just any wood style but hashirama's, that in itself puts madara's fire style above tobirama's water style even if water is fire's weakness. Note wood style is water and earth styles performed by a shinobi with the genes for it.\n",
      " Edo tensei!... Please. When madara felt like it, he undid edo tensei's control over him, something tobirama couldn't when orochimaru used it on him. Even though kabuto's use of the jutsu was more refined than orochimaru's. Besides, short of an edo hashirama, no other shinobi will make any difference to an edo madara. If it’s an alive madara, then only an alive hashirama could defeat him. Flying raijin could give an edge against madara.. if it was minato's. The best (probably only) flying raijin technique tobirama has used is the flying raijin slice, a technique that failed against an alive madara. Sure tobirama was an edo, madara was alive and had hashirama's sage chakra but seriously madara evaded him with his back to tobirama. If edo tobirama was in any way capable of matching up to edo madara, he could have tried doing so the entire time edo madara was waiting for edo hashirama to fight him.\n",
      " Tobirama on the other hand could face madara in a hand to hand or weapons usage. He could even put up a fight when it came to ninjutsu. The moment madara goes susanoo the best tobirama can do is evade with flying raijin. While tobirama is a very strong water style user, he hasn't been shown using it in a continuous form strong enough to match susanoo... the way naruto maintains kurama's avatar or hashirama maintains his wood golem. I doubt he'd even have to use perfect susanoo against tobirama unless he wanted to really intimidate him.\n",
      " On chakra reserves and stamina, madara still outclasses tobirama. The first time madara used perfect susanoo against hashirama, he lost to hashirama completely with madara unable to stand while hashirama had more than enough chakra and stamina. The second time they fought, madara came with kurama which hashirama easily overwhelmed with his sage mode. Madara then fought hashirama until both had barely enough chakra left. Madara had enough chakra to perform a delayed izanagi while hashirama had enough to maintain a wood clone and probably use an earth style. I say so because hashirama probably hid himself in the earth and waited to stab madara in the back. As for whether hashirama used sage mode most of the time it wasn't shown but madara could fight him to that point. Madara can easily outlast tobirama (a senju) if he could fight a senju, ashura reincarnate to that point.\n",
      " Tobirama's jutsus while seemingly strong are too unrefined and lack enough power to ensure he can even fight against madara.\n",

      "In fact, Itachi stated that they were equal in every possible way. Itachi was the top scorer on the Academy Exam, tied with Minato, so he’s easily book-smart enough for his statement to be credible.\n",

      "Tobirama’s speed is insane. For instance, when Juubito blitzed him, Tobirama was able to tag him and counterblitz later on which is a huge reaction speed feat. In conjunction, despite that Tobirama’s blitz attempt against Madara was indisputably a failure, Tobirama still teleported before Madara was able to tag him.\n",
      " Of course, I’m not saying Tobirama’s speed is as fast as any of those characters, just that he has shown the feats to react to them to make EMS Madara being able to tag him very improbable, since EMS Madara is slower than either Juubito or SM Madara.\n",
      "In conjunction, Madara stated he was fully aware of Tobirama’s fighting style, which probably contributed greatly as well as his precognition in terms of intercepting the blitz attempt. (Keep in mind: Edo Tobirama is slower than alive Tobirama as edos have lower stats than alive.)\n",
      " I want to also add one very pertinent aspect, since Madara stated Tobirama was the fastest of his time, it proves Tobirama was faster than Hashirama who is relative to Madara in speed. In fact, Madara’s statement probably includes past Madara himself (EMS). Therefore, Tobirama is still faster than EMS Madara.\n",
      "In crisp contrast, EMS Madara’s attacks and durability are far stronger than Tobirama. Tobirama is too fast for Madara’s attacks, but Madara’s attacks are too strong for Tobirama’s durability.\n",
      " While I still think the result of this battle leans towards Madara, I wanted to debunk the ridiculous notion that it’s a “stomp”.\n",
      "Tobirama vs later versions of Madara:\n",
      "The same analysis above applies for Edo Madara, but is slightly more skewed towards Tobirama, because Alive Madara is stronger than Edo Madara:\n",
      "Despite this scaling, Edo Madara is more problematic for Tobirama because of repertoire and arsenal. The Rinnegan’s Deva Path can greatly restrict Tobirama’s freedom of movement with FTG, and could quite possibly nullify his chances.\n",
      " Regardless of this, Edo Madara is still, in a sense, within the same league as Tobirama although Madara is far stronger. Later versions of Madara without doubt far, far stronger than anything Tobirama can handle.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Tobirama blitzes MS Madara,loses with mid/high difficulty to EMS & Edo Madaraand gets curbstomped by any higher versions of Madara (SM, Juubi, 3E)\n",

      "Answer: Depend which Madara.\n",
      " Alive Madara with the EMS would deal with Tobirama with rather high difficulty. He fought Sage Mode Hashirama near equally with Kurama’s aid.\n",
      "Tobirama cannot use Sage Mode, nor can he use wood release. However, he has access to FTG, although I don’t think he’d be able to do what he did to Izuna. Madara has far larger chakra reserves than Tobirama and would probably outlast him in stamina. However, I don’t think Tobirama gets beaten badly.\n",

      "Answer: If here we're talking about alive Madara, it wouldn't be “wreck”, Madara would win, but he can't wreck Tobirama.\n",
      "Well, you'll even find people saying Tobirama would kill Madara just like he did with Izuna, cause Izuna was as strong as Madara, but what many people possibly forget about this fight, is that Tobirama tricked Izuna with the smoke. And, at that time, Madara and Izuna both only had the MS. Which mean EMS Madara is WAAAYYY faster and stronger than the Izuna that Tobirama killed.\n",
      " Now that we've stated a few things, let's start.\n",
      " How badly would Madara wreck Tobirama :\n",
      " Well, He can't, why though ?\n",
      " 1.- Cause of Flying Thunder God and Tobirama's speed :\n",
      " Tobirama’s speed plus FTG makes it impossible for him to being “wreck”. Cause he can teleport away when ever you're about to hit him. And the fun thing is that FTG take near to “no chakra at all”, cause as it's stated, Minato was able to kill 1000 shinobi in seconds, using FTG. Which would mean teleporting at least 100 time. And Tobirama have more chakra than Minato, so he would be able to evade all off Madara’s attacks without running out of chakra for a long time.\n",
      " 2.- Cause of Tobirama's chakra reserve :\n",
      " While fast and possessing FTG, Tobirama have incredible chakra reserve, not great chakra reserve, but incredible chakra reserve. His chakra reserve is probably nowhere Madara’s, but, as his edotensei version showed it to us, his chakra reserve is… … “WOW”.\n",
      "Well, since he have large amount of chakra, he can fight for a really long time while using FTG to evade Madara's attack.\n",
      " EMS Madara would win, but He can't wreck Tobirama.\n",

      "Question: Who would win, Itachi Uchiha vs Tobirama Senju?\n",
      "Answer: Izanami and Kotoamatsukami combined would probably win the fight. Tobirama uses multishadow clone jutsu. Itachi is able to tell the real one, but fakes it while casting Kotoamatsukami on Tobirama. Both fight, using random jutsu’s. Itachi has almost run out of chakra and they do a taijutsu clash. Both are the same in this subject so both are going for a sword to sword clash. Itachi leaves himself open on-purpose and Tobirama has no choice but to use flying raijin slash. Itachi uses jutsu reflection & Tobirama is stabbed now. Itachi uses Izanami. This is game over for Tobirama. Tobirama has resistance to genjutsu but he cannot use yin release if he does not know he’s in it. He could also use kotoamatsukami to make Tobirama think hes winning, and you may think this is like izanagi. If he thinks he’s winning, Itachi can cast izanami he can hit him with amaterasu then play it in a loop. While Tobirama is getting burnt to death, (In the worlds most powerful genjutsu’s), Itachi can cast his most powerful jutsu’s, finishing him off, then without the flying raijin, itachi can seal him. There are many other scenarios, but I’m an ItachiTard, And thought of a scenario where Itachi wins.\n",

      " In overall knowledge Tobirama has Itachi beat\n",
      " Also if this fight happened Tobirama would know that Itachi is an Uchiha before the fight even begins, how does he do it? he senses the person's chakra and from there he's able to tell what village they're from, what clan, or what their body is made out of( only did that one to Orochimaru)\n",
      " Tobirama has apparently seen Amaterasu before\n",
      "He knowns about the Sussano since he saw Hashirama fighting Madara\n",
      "He knows about the Ems and Ms since Madara and IzunaHe knows about the Uchiha’s genjutsuHe knows about their affinity in fire style\n",

      " If Itachi goes blind or is near blindness it's over for him he wouldn't be able to react to Tobirama anymore and is open for a speed blitz\n",

      " Itachi won't be so eager to use Izanami because it kills one of his eyes\n",

      " The longer the fights goes the more at disadvantage Itachi is since his vision will get worst and has the risk of running out of chakra then it's over for Itachi.\n",
