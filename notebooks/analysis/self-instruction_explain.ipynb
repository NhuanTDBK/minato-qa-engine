It can also form an incredibly strong barrier, which almost seems impregnable. Even Hiruzen Sarutobi could not pierce it..Adamantine Sealing Chains is a Hiden Jutsu, which means that it is a Jutsu that is exclusive to a clan that has been passed down orally through tradition. It is kept secret and is not allowed to be taught to people outside the clan..In this case, the Adamantine Sealing Chains is a Hiden Jutsu belonging to the Uzumaki Clan. Even though this technique is a Hiden Jutsu of the Uzumaki clan, it feels more like Kushina Uzumaki’s signature Jutsu\\\\ which is proven when Kurama almost instantly recognizes her presence despite her not being physically present..Karin Uzumaki is also seen performing this Jutsu, but with her own variation of it called the Adamantine Attacking Chains. She uses it to destroy a wooden statue created by Tobi and many of its hands. She did not have the ability to use this technique before and awakened it during the war..This Jutsu is used in historical moments in the anime. Before Naruto’s parents died, Kushina used the Adamantine Sealing Chains to hold the Nine-tails in order to stop it from rampaging. Later on, when Naruto attempts to take control of the Nine-tails’ Chakra, Kushina appears once again to help him with these sealing chains..Karin awakens her Uzumaki strength during the war, unlocking the Adamantine Sealing Chains. However, she uses it for a different purpose; to attack the wooden statue..Naruto is almost overwhelmed by Kurama’s hatred but is saved by Kushina. She uses her Adamantine Sealing Chains to nullify Kurama and his Chakra. Naruto meets his mother for the first time..Kushina uses the Adamantine Sealing Chains to hold the Nine-tails down.

      "[{'text': 'Adamantine Sealing Chains is a form of Fuinjutsu, also known as a Sealing Jutsu. This technique belongs to the Uzumaki and is a Hiden Technique..While casting this Jutsu, the opponent is chained down by the user using chains which appear out of their torso. The chain which leaves the opponent’s body is fully controlled by the user and not only that, these chains wrap the enemy and entangle them in those chains..Apart from binding the targets down, these chains also neutralise the opponent’s chakra. It can also form an incredibly strong barrier, which almost seems impregnable. Even Hiruzen Sarutobi could not pierce it..Adamantine Sealing Chains is a Hiden Jutsu, which means that it is a Jutsu that is exclusive to a clan that has been passed down orally through tradition. It is kept secret and is not allowed to be taught to people outside the clan..In this case, the Adamantine Sealing Chains is a Hiden Jutsu belonging to the Uzumaki Clan. Even though this technique is a Hiden Jutsu of the Uzumaki clan, it feels more like Kushina Uzumaki’s signature Jutsu\\\\ which is proven when Kurama almost instantly recognizes her presence despite her not being physically present..Karin Uzumaki is also seen performing this Jutsu, but with her own variation of it called the Adamantine Attacking Chains. She uses it to destroy a wooden statue created by Tobi and many of its hands. She did not have the ability to use this technique before and awakened it during the war..This Jutsu is used in historical moments in the anime. Before Naruto’s parents died, Kushina used the Adamantine Sealing Chains to hold the Nine-tails in order to stop it from rampaging. Later on, when Naruto attempts to take control of the Nine-tails’ Chakra, Kushina appears once again to help him with these sealing chains..Karin awakens her Uzumaki strength during the war, unlocking the Adamantine Sealing Chains. However, she uses it for a different purpose; to attack the wooden statue..Naruto is almost overwhelmed by Kurama’s hatred but is saved by Kushina. She uses her Adamantine Sealing Chains to nullify Kurama and his Chakra. Naruto meets his mother for the first time..Kushina uses the Adamantine Sealing Chains to hold the Nine-tails down. She also uses her chains in the form of a shield, keeping the opponents as far away as possible..A. Despite being an Uzumaki, Naruto can not use the Adamantine Sealing Chains as of now. This is because it is a Hiden Jutsu and it probably requires someone to teach the Jutsu to Naruto in order to activate it..A. As of the information available now, it is impossible to break out of the Adamantine Sealing Chains. However, it is unknown what the response would be towards someone like an Otsutsuki, but it could chain down the Nine-tails with ease..A. Karin can not use a complete Adamantine Sealing Chains, making hers an incomplete version called Adamantine Attacking Chains.

Only a few shinobi possess the ability to use all five chakra natures. Because they can cause great harm, fire release techniques are regarded as among the most dangerous..Most fire-style jutsus involve a stream of flames coming from the user's mouth. It may appear as a massive wall of flames, or in rare instances, as a dragon. Fire-StyleJutsu can only be used by shinobi who have the Fire Release chakra nature..Disclaimer: This article will contain spoilers for the popular series Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. Readers are advised to read at their discretion..The ability to emit fire using Fire Style Jutsu stretches back to the Ancient Era. IndraOtsutsuki was observed employing fire release techniques when he first created hand signs. After hand signals became extensively used, numerous people were able to use different fire release techniques. Numerous potent fire-release jutsu were developed over time..Shinobi of the Hidden Leaf Village frequently use fire release jutsu. One of the Three Legendary Sannin of the Hidden Leaf, Jiraya, often used fire-style jutsu. Fire Style: Toad Oil Bomb was one of his signature jutsus..The legendary Uchiha clan of the Hidden Leaf was well-known for its proficiency with fire-style jutsu methods. Members of this clan were primarily adept at fire-style jutsu and possessed fire release. Madara Uchiha, also referred to as The Ghost of the Uchiha, was capable of building a large firewall that took the combined water-style jutsu of more than a dozen shinobi to overcome in his battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces in the FourthGreat Ninja War. Itachi Uchiha, Sasuke Uchiha, and Obito Uchiha are the other renowned Uchiha clan members with an unparalleled skill set in Fire Style Jutsus..Fire Style: Great Fireball Jutsu is the signature jutsu of the Uchiha clan. In this technique, the user infuses chakra into their chest and then releases it from their body, turning the chakra into a great fireball. The destructive power and range of the jutsu differs from user to user. The more the chakra used, the greater the size and destructive power of the fireball..Fire Style: Burning Ash was one of the signature moves of Asuma Sarutobi, a Jonin of the Hidden Leaf Village. The user of this jutsu engulfs the area in chakra-infused gunpowder combined with ash by spewing it from their mouth. The user can then ignite the ash with a spark causing an explosion which in turn burns its target surrounded by the ash. The spewed ash also serves as a smokescreen as it hinders the target visually. Although very useful, it is also very dangerous as the user must be capable of judging the air current, otherwise they could engulf their allies in the ash..Sage Art: Goemon is one of Jiraya’s most powerful jutsus. It is a combination attack that is performed by Jiraiya with the help of Lord Fukasaku and Lady Shima when he is in Honoured Sage Mode. All three work in sync to perform this jutsu. Jiraiya releases a large amount of toad oil and Lord Fukasaku unleashes a Wind Release. At the same moment, Lady Shima uses a Fire Release jutsu which ignites the oil, and the Wind Release technique enrages the flames to a greater extent. Within moments, the surrounding area is engulfed in boiling oil, creating an inferno that reduces everything to cinders..It is a technique used by Jiraiya with Gamabunta. Gamabunta spews a large amount of toad oil aimed at the enemy which Jiraiya then ignites with his Fire Style: Flame Bullet, boosting its range and destructive power..Amaterasu is a legendary Uchiha technique that Itachi and Sasuke Uchiha often used in their battles. Amaterasu is a Fire Style Jutsu that creates ever-burning black flames that do not extinguish until their target is turned into ashes. Itachi and Sasuke acquired this technique after they awakened their Mangekyo Sharingan. It is said that one who possesses the Mangekyo Sharingan can use this jutsu, but Itachi and Sasuke are the only characters who have used this technique..Inferno Style is a variation of the Fire Style unique to Sasuke. Inferno Style: Honoikazuchi is a technique used by Sasuke against Naruto Uzumaki. He pulled Naruto using UniversalPull and then attacked him with a burst of black flames, knocking him down and causing great damage..Inferno Style: Susanoo Flame Control is a high-ranking Fire Style jutsu. It is an application of Inferno Style: Flame Control with Susanoo. In this, Sasuke uses Flame Control to forge various weapons with black flames which can be wielded by the Susanoo..Fire Style: Majestic Destroyer Flame was one of the most powerful Fire Style Jutsus possessed by Madara Uchiha. Madara creates a wall of fire so large that it engulfs everything in its path, leaving nothing but ashes. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, a combined Water Style jutsu of more than a dozen Allied Force shinobi was required to counter this jutsu..A.

The Third Raikge was known to be the strongest ever to hold the leadership position in Kumogakure.', 'img_links': ['https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/4ae9c-16667923756686.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20437%22></svg>', 'https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/f2d95-16667923762130.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20352%22></svg>', 'https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/d208b-16667923768132.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20352%22></svg>', 'https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/8050e-16667923756216.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20576%22></svg>'], 'title': 'A (First Raikage) in Naruto', 'tag': 'characters', 'link': 'https://wiki.sportskeeda.com/naruto/a-first-raikage-in-naruto'}, {'text': 'A was the Second Raikage of Kumogakure. He was also known as the Nidaime Raikage (literally, Second Lightning Shadow). He put a lot of effort into establishing harmony with the other secret communities throughout his rule..A was a longtime bodyguard to the First Raikage before he became the Second Raikage. He went with him to the first Five Kage Summit when he was serving. He stood behind the First and carefully observed the events as they took place..He was appointed Second Raikage after years of hard work and lengthy service. During his rule, A entered Kumogakure into a formal alliance with Konohagakure; however, the Gold and Silver Brothers, who were preparing to launch a coup d’état, ambushed him and the Second Hokage during the ceremony. A’s fate is unknown, but the Hokage is said to have narrowly escaped with his life. Overall, A’s activities greatly aided Kumogakure in establishing peace..A reappeared during the conclusion of the Fourth Shinobi World War when Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki summoned him along with other deceased Kage from the Pure Land to help him and the Hokage call Team 7, the tailed beasts, and Madara Uchiha from Kaguya’s realm. Later, the souls of the other Kage and he were transferred back to the Pure Land..A inherited the strong will of his predecessor to protect Kumogakure. He was also known to be friendly and intelligent, as seen by his well-versed knowledge in politics..A had a dark complexion, a flat and broad nose, and dark eyes with marks underneath. His black shoulder-length hair was styled in an odd way, and he also sported a goatee-shaped stylized beard. Just below his eyes, he also possessed curved-inside sideburns. He was dressed in the Kumo-nin uniform, which consisted of a high-collared shirt with mesh armor underneath and a white forehead protector. Over all this, he was dressed in a somewhat modified version of Kumogakure’s current flak jacket, which appeared to be embellished with medals of some sort. He also wore metal armor that resembled samurai armor and covered his right shoulder. He also had a rectangular, gold-colored mark on his nose..Before becoming the Second Raikage, he wore a long-sleeved dark shirt that could be opened to expose a mesh-armor shirt underneath, coupled with dark-colored leggings, a simple headband, and a scarf that hung around his neck..Not much of A’s skills have been revealed, but the fact that he was chosen to be the Second Raikage suggests he was unquestionably a skilled shinobi. His abilities were such that, even before becoming a Kage, he was chosen to serve as his predecessor’s guard, for which he became well known. He was also said to be knowledgeable about political matters, which suggests that he was intelligent..A. Throughout the history of Kumogakure, the first four Raikage each had a given name A, which is a coincidence. Each A had a tag team partner named “B”, who was responsible for defending the Raikage and bringing out the Raikage’s full power..A. A’s other name hasn’t been known. He was known as the Nidaime Raikage (Second Lightning Shadow).', 'img_links': ['https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/73bae-16672248397230.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20468%22></svg>', 'https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/db956-16672248402403.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20352%22></svg>', 'https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/6b0d1-16672248408686.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20352%22></svg>', 'https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/f1ff1-16672248396403.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20624%20759%22></svg>'], 'title': 'A (Second Raikage) in Naruto', 'tag': 'characters', 'link': 'https://wiki.sportskeeda.com/naruto/a-second-raikage-in-naruto'}]\n"

They are the 16th generation of Ino–Shika–Chō (Boar–Deer–Butterfly) team, a name commonly given to the trios from the Yamanaka, Nara and Akimichi clans. They were led by the Jonin named Asuma Sarutobi, who was the grandson of third Hokage and Team Asuma are known for their exceptional team work and camaraderie. After Asuma’s death, the team was led by Hatake Kakashi briefly to avenge his death. Though not active, they are assumed to be working together..Team 10 or also known as the Ino-Shika-Cho trio is a team known for its exceptional teamwork even though they tend to argue sometimes. They were read at stalling their opponents and were led by Asuma Sarutobi..During the two and half years, the second chunnin exams took place and Sakura temporarily joined team 10 as her teammates weren’t there and a team of three is required. Asuma had kept Shikamaru in charge as he was already a chunin..They lost Asuma while fighting an Akatsuki member and after Asuma's death, Kakashi led Team 10 temporarily to help them avenge Asuma's death and they were successful in doing so. They were also a part of the whole plan to go and personally kill Sasuke after he had attacked Kumogakure and to prevent any international war between the nation. Naruto tried to talk to them to let him persuade Sasuke to which they agreed..The team is assumed to be active without a permanent leader..This was a joint mission with team 7 and they were sent to rescue the daughter of the village head who was taken hostage by a bandit leader known as Baji. They were successful due to Shikamaru's intelligence and strategy skills and rescued the girl..Team 10 was sent to help Kosuke Marubaosgu who was being hunted by a group of shinobis. With the help of their teamwork and tactics, they managed to defeat the shinobis and saved Kosuke..When Asuma was killed by Hidan, team 10 swore that they would avenge their master. Tsunade forbade them from going and objected to Shikamaru's reckless revenge plan and refused to let them take the mission as they weren't a four-man cell. However, Kakashi stepped up and led them to go and fight Hidan and Kakuzu again. They were later on aided by team Yamato too. With the help of Shikamaru's elaborate and great plan, they managed to defeat and kill both Hidan and Kakuzu..A. Sakura calls her that for fun or teasing purposes because Ino’s name means boar..A. Karui is Choji’s wife in Boruto and she belongs to Kumogakure. After marrying Choji she immigrates to Konohagakure..A. In Boruto the current age of Shikamaru is 33. He is the Hokage’s(Naruto) advisor and also like his right-hand man.\",\n",
