      "The  is an Outer Path technique that allows a Rinnegan user to manipulate up to six bodies as though they are their own. Usage The user embeds one or more black receivers into a body, allowing them to channel their chakra into it from great distances. To make full use of the body, the user ideally transmits their chakra from the highest and closest point possible so that they can have the best possible range.Naruto chapter 428, pages 14-15 Once their chakra enters the body, they are given complete control of it, allowing them to decide all of its actions, its use of jutsu, and even speak through it. As a representation of this control, the controlled bodies' eyes take on the same appearance as the user's.Naruto chapter 544, pages 16-17 Inoichi Yamanaka compared this technique to the Yamanaka clan's Mind Body Switch Technique, albeit on a greater scale.A first-person perspective of the Rinnegan's shared vision.When multiple bodies are controlled together the user is able to see through all of their eyes, thus registering six separate fields of vision at the same time. With this shared vision, the user can coordinate their attacks and provide defences for their blind spots. For this reason, the Six Paths of Pain are strongest when used together, employing combination tactics, the element of surprise, and/or sheer overwhelming power to defeat their enemies.The technique has a drawback. If the caster of the technique is interrupted in any way while transmitting chakra to the bodies being used as part of the technique, then all of the bodies will stop moving and become very vulnerable to attack. Nagato's Paths Nagato's Six Paths of Pain (with a new Animal Path).Nagato created the Six Paths of Pain after he was left crippled during a battle with Hanzō. Unable to move or act on his own, he controlled six corpses to carry out his will as part of his \"Pain\" identity.Naruto chapter 443, page 3 In the anime, the first body used, belonged to his childhood friend Yahiko,Naruto: Shippūden episode 348 which was his favourite. To match his late friend's hair colour, he had the other Paths' hair dyed to the same colour, including eyebrows. Nagato's first Six Paths of Pain were composed of individuals that Jiraiya had met when they were alive. Nagato implants their black receivers all over their bodies as body piercings.Each of the Six Paths of Pain can be used to perform any technique that Nagato himself is capable of, however, he limits each body to one branch of the Six Paths Techniques, the exception being Yahiko's body (the Deva Path) through which he performs a number of miscellaneous jutsu; the King of Hell and the creatures summoned by the Animal Path are part of his shared vision. Nagato refers to each body by the Path it embodies and has them serve specific purposes, be it offensive or defensive, reconnaissance or repair. Each of the Paths has its own importance in a fight – the Naraka Path's ability to restore all the other Paths making it the most valuable – and therefore, Nagato will sacrifice other Paths to protect those further up the hierarchy.Because of his lack of mobility, Nagato requires a great deal of preparation time to use his Six Paths of Pain, especially when moving outside his usual residence in Amegakure. Some of the Six Paths Techniques are very chakra-taxing, and in order to use them Nagato must either bring the respective body closer to his positionNaruto chapter 438, page 17 or alternatively cut off control of the other five Paths and focus all of his chakra into the one.Naruto chapter 429, page 10 The greatest weakness of his Six Paths of Pain is that each body has only one primary ability; if an enemy has prior knowledge of what body does what, they stand a better chance of defeating the Paths. Sensors can track the chakra Nagato spends to control the paths back to him, exposing his real location. This is usually mitigated by Nagato's frequent changing of his chakra signature. It took Naruto stabbing himself with one of Nagato's black receivers to create a direct connection to track him with his Sage Mode sensing.The room where the bodies are kept.When not in use, Nagato stores the bodies in a hidden chamber within Amegakure's tallest tower. Within the room are six \"pods\", in which the bodies rested; each pod is connected to the wall via pipes or wires and has a sliding cover that appears to feature the symbol of Amegakure, which conceals the face of the inactive body. The pods are also numbered from one through six using daiji characters and are ordered counter-clockwise around the room with a numbering scheme that corresponds with the ordering of the six Buddhist Paths of Reincarnation:  - Deva Path.  - Asura Path.   - Human Path.   - Animal Path.  - Preta Path.   - Naraka Path. Obito's Paths Obito's Six Paths in partial transformations.Obito Uchiha creates his own Six Paths of Pain during the Fourth Shinobi World War using the reincarnated jinchūriki.Naruto chapter 544, pages 16-17 Obito controls his Six Paths using a single black receiver embedded into the left side of each of their chests, which were hidden from view. When transformed into the tailed beast, the receivers move from the chest to the neck. He also seals their respective tailed beast back into their bodies, which he maintains control of through the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.Naruto chapter 570, pages 2-4 Obito forcing the jinchūriki into their full tailed beast forms.Obito can force the jinchūriki to transform into their full Tailed Beast Modes, but this carries an increased risk of the beasts subverting his commands.Naruto chapter 567, pages 7-9 Because of how much effort it requires to keep six tailed beasts under his control at once, Obito does not channel the Six Paths Techniques into his Six Paths of Pain.Naruto chapter 567, page 14 Rather, he uses the same abilities that they had when they were alive, such as Rōshi's Lava Release and Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu. With Obito's Sharingan, through which he sees what his Paths see, he is able to more precisely synchronise and deploy their abilities.Naruto chapter 565, page 9 Influences Based upon the six Buddhist Paths of Reincarnation, each body was named after one of the different Paths: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these Paths, or realms, represents one of the realms a being is reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives. While the two lower Paths, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher Paths, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be Paths of suffering because they perpetuate the cycle of Reincarnation; the only way to break it and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment. Trivia  In the anime, Nagato's Six Paths spoke in Yahiko's voice, with the exception of Nagato's second Animal Path. The latter had a female voice as it was a woman. Three of Nagato's Six Paths of Pain are playable in Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, while the other three appear as support characters. All six are able to appear simultaneously in three-versus-one match-ups. The playable ones are Deva, Asura and Animal, the ones whose primary function is battle, rather than support. While talking to Tobi about the Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation technique, Kabuto Yakushi uses the term  to refer to the six bodies Nagato used to fight Jiraiya.Naruto chapter 520 See Also  Dead Soul Technique Nine Masked Beasts \n",

      "Synopsis Using his ink mice, Sai locates Kabuto hiding out in one of Orochimaru's old hideouts. Before he can go in, Tokuma Hyūga and his squad arrive, notifying captain Anko that Sai was to return to Konoha immediately while they take his place in the Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party. Anko asks what happened, due to the fact that Yamato had left abruptly and stated it was an emergency. Tokuma reveals that the Akatsuki mounted an attack on the village and that it was destroyed, and that due to Tsunade's coma, Danzō had been appointed Hokage.Meanwhile, Team Samui make their way to Konoha, surprised at its destruction. Samui takes the Fourth Raikage's letter to Tsunade, only to discover that Tsunade is in a coma. She demands to see the acting Hokage, and Danzō enters the tent and proclaim himself as the village's Sixth Hokage. The letter requests that the village take action on missing-nin Sasuke Uchiha and to hand over all intel gathered on him. Danzō agrees, and passes down an official order to eliminate Sasuke.Sai is told by Danzō to keep an eye on Naruto, whom he promises not to harm at the moment due to the fact that Naruto is viewed as the village's hero. Kiba finds Naruto, Sakura and Kakashi, who are about to leave the village, and relays what has transpired. Naruto and Sakura attempt to extract information from Sai regarding Danzō, but Sai reveals that he has a cursed seal on his tongue that prevents him from doing so. He tells the duo that all members of Root are branded with the seal to eradicate any attempts of interrogation should they be captured. Naruto asks Sai why Danzō has called out for Sasuke's assassination, which shocks Sai since he was not made aware of the fact. The mention of Sasuke's name has the trio held at sword point by Karui and Omoi, who stuns them by revealing that Sasuke kidnapped their master and is a member of the Akatsuki. As Sakura begins to cry, the two Kumo-nin berate them for not being able to understand what it feels like to know that their master may have been killed. Recalling how he felt when Jiraiya died, Naruto asks whether their master is a jinchūriki, much to their shock. Naruto tells them that the Akatsuki capture jinchūriki alive and therefore their master is not dead yet, and notifies them that he is a jinchūriki as well. He agrees to help them look for their master, and Karui accepts his offer, asking him to debrief them about Sasuke on the way.Elsewhere, Taka continue on their path towards Konoha, only to be blocked by Madara. Sasuke tells Madara that Taka has left the Akatsuki, but Madara explains that they blundered in their attempt to catch the Eight-Tails and thus must make amends. His associate, Zetsu, appears and notifies Madara that Danzō has been made Hokage, much to Sasuke's indignation, since Danzō was one of Konoha's elders who forced Itachi to massacre his own clan. Madara reveals that Konoha had been destroyed by Pain while Zetsu notifies the group that a Five Kage Summit has been called. Credits pl:Szósty Hokage Danzō\n",

      "was an elder of Konohagakure. As the founder and leader of Root, Danzō gained notoriety as Naruto chapter 459, page 1 because of his frequent unsanctioned actions and his often-suspected (but rarely proven) undermining of specific Konoha personnel. Despite his decades of suspicious deeds, Danzō only ever acted in what he believed were the village's best interests. He was appointed the Kai no Sho page 116 after Pain's Assault, but died before he could be formally approved to the position. Background Born into the Shimura Clan to his shinobi father, Danzō went onto joining the Academy, where he was amongst the first few hundred of students to graduate. From his genin days, he was acquainted with Hiruzen Sarutobi,Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light page 139 whom he became rivals with in everything.Naruto chapter 481, page 8 Danzō once saw the First Hokage in battle, where he witnessed Hashirama's formidable Wood Release.Danzō during the First Shinobi World War.During the First Shinobi World War, Danzō, as part of the Escort Unit alongside Kagami Uchiha, Torifu Akimichi and Team Tobirama, became surrounded by Kumogakure's Kinkaku Squad. Having concluded that a member of their team had to sacrifice themselves as a decoy in order for the rest of them to escape, Danzō struggled to bring himself to volunteer. As Hiruzen proclaimed to take the role, Danzō called himself weak while a part of him was relieved. Lashing out at Hiruzen for volunteering before he could, the Second Hokage decided to be the decoy instead, while appointing Hiruzen as his successor to Danzō's shock. The team then managed to escape at the cost of Tobirama's life.With Hiruzen having beaten him to the title of Hokage, Danzō began planning to someday attain the title himself.Naruto chapter 285, page 17 Taking up the village's more clandestine operations — something that Hiruzen noted because of his own indulgence, he allowed Danzō to doNaruto chapter 627, page 5 — he created the Anbu subsidiary named Root, with the organisation under Danzō's direct command. Within this group, Danzō himself hand-picked various young shinobi with noticeable potential to join.Naruto: Shippūden episode 317Danzō manipulates Hanzō into an alliance against Akatsuki.During the Third Shinobi World War, Danzō agreed to provide aid to Hanzō of Amegakure in order to receive help in claiming the title of Hokage, sending some of his forces to deal with Akatsuki, but they were all wiped out by Nagato.Naruto chapter 446, page 13Naruto chapter 447, pages 6-11 In the anime, it is revealed Danzō had manipulated Hanzō into joining forces with him against Akatsuki, having brought him the corpses of Ame shinobi or members of Hanzō's own clan, claiming they were killed by Akatsuki. In truth, they were Root members who had been disguised as Iwa shinobi, the members in question dying during Nagato's rampage which had him unconsciously summoning the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path after he saw his two friends, Yahiko and Konan being attacked, the group also along with undercover shinobi teams participating in events to disrupt a treaty of peace between Konohagakure and Iwagakure. Taking advantage of the situation, Danzō had the bodies collected as well as any traces of his team's involvement removed before arriving at Hanzō's residence to inform the other man of the development. When Hanzō began expressing doubts, Danzō informed the other man the Akatsuki were wolves disguised as sheep who would usurp his power. Once the two shinobi joined forces, Danzō approached Akatsuki, disguised as an Ame shinobi named , revealing himself to be an adviser to Hanzō, informing them that Hanzō was allowing the group to make peace negotiations, which of course was a ruse concocted by the allied shinobi. He later handed the group a scroll confirming it and saw them celebrating before he departed. The next day, Danzo and his men witnessed the confrontation between Hanzō, Yahiko and Nagato, Hanzō offering to let Konan go if Nagato killed Yahiko but when Nagato refused, Yahiko committed suicide by impaling himself on a kunai Nagato was holding that saw Yahiko dying much to Konan's distress. This prompted Nagato to summon the Demonic Statue which attacked the Root and Amegakure shinobi who had been watching the incident from the cliff, ultimately killing them while Nagato saved Konan but at the cost of his legs being damaged by Hanzō's Fire Release: Exploding Flame Formation. Both Hanzō and Danzō fled, Hanzō using the Body Flicker Technique to escape seconds before Nagato attempted to kill him while Danzō left through unknown means.Danzō enlists Kabuto into Root.At some point in time, Danzō also had dealings with Orochimaru, who accompanied him, along with Tatsuma Aburame, to Konoha Orphanage where he strong-armed a former Anbu agent, Nonō, to infiltrate Iwagakure and confirm the intel on what the village was planning. Soon after, Danzō noticed Kabuto Yakushi spying from the window and decided to recruit the boy as well.Naruto chapter 583, pages 3-8 However, in time, both Kabuto and Nonō became assets too dangerous to be left alive and Danzō tricked a brainwashed Nonō into killing Kabuto. Danzō sent Orochimaru to ensure no survivors, however, he instead took Kabuto under his wing without Danzō's knowledge. At some point, Orochimaru also surgically replaced Danzō's right arm with Shin Uchiha's, infusing the limb with Hashirama Senju's DNA to modify his physical energy.Naruto chapter 478, page 11Naruto chapter 700+7, page 11 Later in the anime, when Hiruzen sought to end the bloodshed from the Third Shinobi World War through a truce with the other villages, Danzō voiced his disdain, feeling that a such an act was spitting on the memory of all the Konoha shinobi who died so far. Understanding Danzō's intent, Hiruzen decided to take responsibility for the loss by stepping down as Hokage. At a meeting with the Land of Fire Council, Danzō strongly suggested that Orochimaru be made Fourth Hokage. Hiruzen, however, pointed out that Orochimaru had grown power-hungry and showed signs of sinister intent. Ultimately, Minato Namikaze was elected as Fourth Hokage unanimously, excluding Danzō who detested the idea, feeling that following Hiruzen's ideology will ultimately destroy Konoha.Naruto: Shippūden episode 349Danzō asks Kakashi to join his forces.In the anime -- during Kurama's attack on Konoha -- Danzō insisted that the Uchiha Clan not be allowed to join in the defence of the village, fearing that someone like Madara Uchiha would take advantage of the situation and use the Nine-Tails against Konoha. Ultimately, he convinced Hiruzen to have the Uchiha purely protect the citizens and avoid the Nine-Tails.Naruto: Shippūden episode 358 After Kurama was stopped, Danzō was one of the elders to suspect the Uchiha clan was behind the attack, and began a spying operation on them, relocating the Uchiha to the outskirts of the village. With the Fourth Hokage sacrificing himself to seal away the Nine-Tails inside his son, Hiruzen humbly resumed his role as Third Hokage, much to Danzō's disdain. Afterwards, Danzō approached a grieving young Kakashi Hatake, noting that it was Hiruzen's orders for the children, even high-ranking ninja like Kakashi, to not help battle the Nine-Tails, ultimately preventing Kakashi from possibly saving his sensei and his wife. Convincing an emotional Kakashi that Hiruzen was not best for the future of the village, Kakashi agreed to join Danzō's Root division and spy on Hiruzen for him.Naruto: Shippūden episode 350 Later, as the Third Hokage resumed his role, Danzō, no longer able to tolerate Hiruzen's overly passive methods, sought to dispose of him. He sent several Root members to assassinate Hiruzen. However, a smug Danzō was soon approached by Hiruzen, who revealed that Kakashi informed him of the assassination attempt. As Danzō feared for his life knowing he could be executed for his treasonous actions, Hiruzen calmly chose to spare Danzō, keeping this event a secret on the condition Danzō agreed to dedicate his life to protecting the village. Quickly recomposing himself, Danzō plainly stated that Hiruzen's naive faith and mercy would be his end one day, to which the Third solemnly admitted may be so. Later, Danzō met with Orochimaru, telling him about the recent events and insisted they not meet for a while in fear Hiruzen might realise that Danzō and Orochimaru were behind the abduction of several Konoha citizens, to which the Sannin voiced that Hiruzen probably already has his suspicions.Naruto: Shippūden episode 351 However, Orochimaru did another implant onto Danzō taking Shin's Sharingan-embedded arm and placing that, alongside some of Hashirama's cells, onto that of Danzō's.Naruto chapter 700+7, pages 12-13Danzō dispatches Kinoe to inform the clan.Later, Orochimaru's sinister actions were discovered by the Third Hokage, forcing the Sannin to abandon Konoha. When Danzō learned of this, he knew Orochimaru would most likely go to their hideout with the Iburi clan. He sent Kinoe to inform the clan of Orochimaru's arrival.Naruto: Shippūden episode 352 Danzō's true goal was to have Kinoe capture Orochimaru, agreeing with Hiruzen that Orochimaru was too dangerous to let go rogue.Naruto: Shippūden episode 353 Over the years, Danzō continued to recruit new members of Root, including Torune Aburame of the Aburame clan. Three years after Orochimaru's defection from the village, fearing that his stolen Sharingan eye would soon go blind from its overuse, Danzō sent Kinoe in an attempt to steal Kakashi's Sharingan as a replacement.Naruto: Shippūden episode 355 Kinoe soon returned, having chosen to abandon his mission, much to Danzō's fury. Reminding the young shinobi of his duties as a Root member, Kinoe insisted that they should not attack allies to Konoha, which Danzō proclaimed that Root's only true allies is its own and exists only to protect Konoha itself. Unable to accept Danzō's cold views, Kinoe spoke out, making his feelings known. Horrified to see how much Kinoe had changed, Danzō used his Sharingan to incapacitate Kinoe, having one of his men take Kinoe to have his cursed seal activated. As Danzō arrived at the operating room, he discovered Kakashi freeing Kinoe and retreating with him. Danzō and his men soon surrounded the duo. As Kinoe was still under Danzō's command and Kakashi had trespassed on Root territory, Danzō had full authority to execute them. Before Danzō could act, the Third Hokage arrived, revealing that Kakashi was sent on his orders with a summoning request to be delivered to Danzō. No longer able to attack, Danzō faked ignorance of Hiruzen's letter and called off his men. Hiruzen then spoke to Danzō about Kinoe and his abilities. Insisting that Konoha needed the Wood Release, Danzō agreed to hand over Kinoe to Hiruzen's command but chose to not remove Kinoe's cursed seal.Naruto: Shippūden episode 356 Three years later, a potential alliance between Konoha and the Land of Woods was made. While a team was sent to exchange secret scrolls with the Wood-nin as a sign of trust, a small team of Anbu, under Danzō's command, was sent to observe under the suspicion that the Wood-nin would betray Konoha, in which case, the Anbu were ordered to kill them. Danzō chose Kakashi, still having high respect for his abilities, and the new recruit Danzō recommended into Anbu, Itachi Uchiha, as a two-man team for the mission.Naruto: Shippūden episode 357Two years later, when word reached Konoha's leadership of a planned coup d'état by the Uchiha clan, Danzō took advantage of Itachi's pacifist tendencies and convinced him to provide him and the other elders with information of the clan's actions. When Shisui Uchiha, acknowledged for his unquestionable loyalty to Konohagakure, presented his plan of ceasing the Uchiha's coup by casting Kotoamatsukami on his clansmen to the Council, Hiruzen agreed. Danzō, however, determined to protect the village in his own way and, believing that Shisui may try to manipulate him as well, stole the latter's right eye, implanting it into his socket, with Shisui committing suicide sometime later.Naruto chapter 550, page 13 When Hiruzen decided to end the coup diplomatically, Danzō secretly met with Itachi and inveigled him into choosing to slaughter his clan by presenting him with the option of killing them and sparing his younger brother, Sasuke Uchiha or letting them go through with the coup and having them all killed as a result.Naruto chapter 590, pages 8-10 Itachi regretfully chose to kill the Uchiha clan. Hiruzen disbands Danzō's organisation. Soon after the deed was done, Danzō told everyone that Itachi had done this out of his own will, having grown to despise his clan and even sought greater power by stealing Shisui's eyes. While everyone else believed this fabricated story, Hiruzen saw through Danzō's lie, voicing his disgust at Danzō's actions. While trying to justify his actions by claiming it was for the village, Hiruzen retorted that the Uchiha were part of the village and never actually performed any treachery before their demise. No longer able to trust Danzō and his underhanded ways, Hiruzen immediately removed him from the Council and ordered for his Root division to be disbanded.Naruto Shippūden episode 359 Afterwards, Itachi's clone, disguised as a Root member, approached Danzō and threatened to expose Konoha's secrets to the other countries if Danzō ever harmed Sasuke.Naruto chapter 400, page 13 He met with Tobi around this time for reasons unknown.Naruto chapter 474, page 12 Over the years, despite his Root division being officially disbanded, Danzō continued to keep it secretly active.During the Konoha Crush, the Fourth Raikage insinuated that the invasion was a secret plot of Danzō with Akatsuki to dispose of both the Hiruzen and the Fourth Kazekage; however, it is unknown whether this actually happened. After seeing Hiruzen sacrifice himself using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal to defeat Orochimaru, Danzō decided to teach Sai how to use a powerful fūinjutsu, in order to prevent the same from happening to himself. During the training, Danzō noted that Sai could use \"emotional energy\" to bolster the power of the attack but warned the young man not to fall prey to his negative emotions.Naruto: Shippūden episode 284 Personality When he was younger, Danzō was a hotheaded and eager ninja with a strong desire to prove himself. He, after a long internal struggle, decided to volunteer himself to buy time for his teammates, though Hiruzen beat him to it.Naruto chapter 481, page 7 He often displayed jealousy towards Hiruzen, believing he was always one step ahead of him and feeling inferior to him. Danzō never used soft words like \"friend\", as he never wanted to lean on someone or be leaned on. As an adult, Danzō was a completely calm, cold and collected individual who did not allow his emotions to surface. Having fought many wars, and having looked up to his father's and grandfather's example of dying in battle, he came to disagree with other Hokage, believing that the interests of the village should be placed above all else, even ethics and morals. Danzō seemed to hate the previous Hokage's beliefs stating those beliefs have destroyed the village after Pain's assault on it, despite using the attack as an attempt to overthrow Tsunade and leaving its citizens in peril as well as being responsible for Nagato's negative perceptions of Konoha, which lead to its destruction. According to Koharu Utatane, Danzō was very ambitious, but she also stated that all he ever did was for the sake of the village. In the anime, his desire to be a greater and stronger Hokage than Hiruzen made him even attempt to have Hiruzen assassinated in the belief that the Third Hokage had lost the capacity to effectively lead the village. An extremist, Danzō preferred to directly eliminate threats through assassination and execution rather than diplomacy and negotiation. However, he secretly worked closely with the international criminal Orochimaru in illegal experiments in order to increase his physical capabilities. Danzō possessed a fanatical and arbitrary adherence to the ideals of a shinobi, believing they must sacrifice absolutely everything for the village. However, Danzō hypocritically feared death, hiding this fear behind a belief that his survival was necessary for the sake of the shinobi world itself. He would only conquer this fear in the last moments of his life, boldly attempting to kill Sasuke and Tobi for the sake of his village and the entire shinobi world with his suicide, and destroying Shisui's eye with his dying breath.After years in Hiruzen's shadow, Danzō begins to actualize his goal of becoming Hokage.Despite his reputation as a militarist, Danzō ultimately sought peace for the ninja world, one he would achieve by uniting all shinobi forces under his control. As such, he sought the title of Hokage, waiting patiently for decades before an opportunity arose. Danzō's pursuit of peace followed an ends justifies the means. As such, he had no remorse taking any immoral actions as long as he believed it would benefit Konoha. To that end, he worked in the shadows to ensure that this future came to fruition. He used Root to eliminate potential threats to Konohagakure with or without the consent of the Hokage and to further him along the path to achieving the position, as he believed he was best prepared for the \"necessary\" transition. Because of the nature of his actions, Danzō could not allow the details of what he had done to become public knowledge, and thus he branded members of Root with cursed seals to prevent them from revealing his secrets.Naruto chapter 452, page 8 Danzō also believed Konoha was strongest and most stable when the village had a target to focus its anger and hatred on. To this end, Danzō was key in stigmatising the Uchiha clan to the rest of the village and was the one to secretly leak out the knowledge that Naruto Uzumaki was the container of the Nine-Tailed Fox, ensuring the villagers would loathe him as a result.Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night Danzō also views the members of Root as expendable pawns and shows no remorse in having them perform duties that could result in permanent injury as shown in his ordering Fū to gouge out Ao's Byakugan, despite the fact it would result in Fū losing his eye as well.Danzō is also treacherous by nature. Likewise, should an \"ally\" prove too capable for his comfort, Danzō will see to their elimination, as he attempted to do with both Nonō and Kabuto. Itachi also believed Danzō had no intention of honouring his promise of sparing Sasuke when he accepted the mission to kill his own clan and had to threaten to leak Konoha's secrets to enemy villages and risk his own safety by returning to Konoha after Hiruzen's death to protect Sasuke's life. He was willing to do anything to further his physical and political powers, as shown in allowing himself to be experimented on with Hashirama's cells by Orochimaru in order to gain the power to control a tailed beast and extend his use of Izanagi. He also broke international law by manipulating Mifune into making him supreme commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces. In his later years, Danzō had become somewhat delusional, believing that he would be able to change the Shinobi World, even though his actions at the Kage Summit lost him his credibility. Danzō also had no hesitation in stealing Shisui's right eye in order to gain access to Kotoamatsukami despite his unquestionable loyalty to Konoha over his own clan and the fact he was a descendant of someone who had once been Danzō's own comrade. Tobi deduced Danzō's intent was to seize control of the Nine-Tails from Naruto by using his multiple Sharingan. Danzō is also shown to be extremely arrogant, as seen in his gloating during his final clash with Sasuke, believing he had won, and only he is capable of changing the entire world.Despite his self-righteous, amoral, and draconian methods, Danzō had a sense of nobility and dignity. He reprimanded Sasuke for his hatred and violence against Konoha, saying that it had wasted both the sacrifice of the Uchiha and Itachi's own personal sacrifices.Naruto chapter 477, page 11 Like Hiruzen, he used the final moments of his life to help Konoha by trying to take Sasuke and Tobi with him. Despite his envy against the Third and their growing rivalry, he seemed to still care for his boyhood friendship with Hiruzen, reminiscing of his childhood memories with him and asking what he was to Hiruzen in his final moments.Naruto chapter 481, page 12 His fellow elders, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, held Danzō in high regard, and often took his advice when dealing with the politics of the village. It is unknown how much they knew about the full extent of his actions. Appearance Danzō's full appearance.Danzō appeared as a frail, old man, who would normally walk with a cane. He had black, shaggy hair, and his right eye was bandaged — concealing a Sharingan underneath. Danzō has had an x-shaped scar on his chin ever since his youth. He wore a white shirt, with a black or dark grey robe over the top of it covering from his feet, to just over his right shoulder. The robe conceals his right arm which was bandaged, and covered with three large golden braces. The bandages hid an arm implanted with ten more Sharingan, originally belonging to Shin Uchiha, and the image of the First Hokage's face protruding from his right shoulder where Hashirama's cells were injected into his body.In his youth Danzō was quite handsome. He had the same shaggy hairstyle, except it was much longer, reaching eye level. He also wore the standard armour of that era, which covered his back, chest areas and lower abdomen while leaving his shoulders armourless. With this he wore a black outfit with matching wrist guards, a shuriken holster on his right upper leg, a pouch tied to his waist with bandages, and a Konoha forehead protector. At that time, he still has both of his normal brown eyes. He hid the right eye with bandages by the time he united with Hanzō in their attack against Akatsuki led by Yahiko, and wore a flak jacket. It was also shown that at least around the time of the Third Shinobi World War, he wore a black, hooded trench coat and high-length sandals. As a child, Danzō's attire consisted of a short dark-green kimono tied with a sash.Naruto: Shippūden episode 211 During his meeting with Akatsuki, having adopted the name, \"Kanzō\", Danzō had long shaggy brown hair, an eyepatch over his right eye with a gas mask hanging around his neck as well as an Amegakure forehead protector. He also wore a dark coat with a shirt visible underneath as well as gloves around both his hands, a pouch on his right leg with bandages visible around both his legs and sandals. Abilities Danzō with the capability to control a tailed beast.As the leader of the Root and the Sixth Hokage Candidate, Danzō was an exceptionally powerful shinobi. Danzō's skills were held in high regard by the elders Homura and Koharu as they considered him one of Konoha's strongest ninja.Naruto chapter 488, page 14 Through skill and trickery, Danzō managed to combat the famed Shisui Uchiha and catch him off guard to steal his right eye. Kakashi expressed intense shock learning Danzō had been defeated single-handedly by Sasuke Uchiha. However, this defeat was partly attributed to his old age, and being unable to use Shisui Uchiha's Mangekyō Sharingan. Despite all this, even with Sasuke's excessive usage of his own Mangekyō Sharingan, Danzō still fought evenly with Sasuke throughout their battle, and dealt him a potentially fatal wound.Danzō was adept in both using and dispelling high-level genjutsu, even from powerful Sharingan-users like Sasuke. He also had some skill in taijutsu and a decent amount of physical strength, able to repel Karin with one kick.Naruto chapter 478, page 4 Danzō was also quite fast and agile as he was able to catch Sasuke off-guard and, in the anime, evade a large amount of debris falling on him. Additionally, Danzō was highly skilled in kenjutsu, as seen against the Prajñā Group. Ninjutsu Danzō's summon, Baku.Danzō was well-versed in fūinjutsu and cursed seals. To prevent his secrets from being exposed, Danzō placed binding seals on the tongues of each Root member. Should a Root member speak openly of Root and Danzō's activities, the seal would instantly paralyse the member's body. Danzō could also implement binding seals in battle, temporarily paralysing the foe. Danzō most powerful seal was the Reverse Four Symbols Sealing. It caused four seal symbols to exit from his chest and form a large sphere around him. Everything inside the sphere was then drawn in and imprisoned within his corpse. Danzō could summon a giant tapir-like creature known as a Baku, described as the \"Nightmare-Eater\". A creature of massive size, it had the ability to suck in objects and targets within the area in front of it. The Baku's suction could also be used to increase the power of Danzō's Wind Release techniques. However, using the suction left the creature vulnerable against fire techniques. Nature Transformation Danzō adding wind-natured chakra onto his kunai.Danzō could utilise Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire Release in nature transformation, as well as Yin and Yang Release. He was particularly proficient in Wind Release, exhaling powerful vacuum-based attacks able to slash like blades or pierce like bullets. He could also use larger or localised variations, strong enough to destroy an extremely durable wooden dome or damage a humanoid Susanoo's defences.Naruto chapter 479. pages 8-9 Danzō's Wind Release could also help him manoeuvre in mid-air, as well as enhance the offensive power of his weapons.Danzō's use of Wood Release.Possessing the First Hokage's cells in his right arm granted Danzō the Wood Release, albeit with a significant toll on his chakra. This combined with his overall rudimentary control and skill with it prompted him to only use it when necessary. It also appeared that he could only use the Wood Release from his modified right arm although he could do so without using hand seals. After suffering a fatal wound from Sasuke, Danzō lost control of Hashirama's cells, prompting him to sever his arm as it began to rapidly grow into a large tree that threatened to engulf him completely. Body Modifications Hashirama's cells (forming a face) alongside the Sharingan on his transplanted arm.Danzō's right arm originally belonged to Shin Uchiha. It was implanted with ten Sharingan and enhanced with Hashirama Senju's cells. Ao also noted that the colour of the chakra in his right arm was also that of Shisui's.Naruto chapter 459, page 14 He normally kept the arm hidden under bandages and a gauntlet-like seal, presumably to conserve chakra and keep the eyes and DNA in check. Due to integration of Hashirama's cells, Danzō also gained the shinobi's ability to heal nearly any wound without the use of hand seals.Fourth Databook According to Tobi, Danzō's possession of both Uchiha and Senju DNA also mean he possessed the potential capability to control Kurama.Naruto chapter 478, page 16 Dōjutsu  Sharingan Danzō's imbedded Sharingan.Danzō's right eye was that of Shisui Uchiha's Sharingan, though, in the anime, Shisui's was not the first one Danzō possessed. He was very skilled at using it, able to detect multiple assassins hidden among his surroundingsNaruto chapter 456, page 3 and subdue individuals with genjutsu. Danzō could use Izanagi, a technique forbidden even amongst the Uchiha clan. While activated, Danzō's own body became a physical illusion, nullifying any injury he received from an opponent. This allowed him to survive otherwise fatal attacks while retaining the ability to inflict physical harm to his opponent. Izanagi gave him another benefit; after being \"killed\", Danzō would appear elsewhere away from danger to catch his foes off guard.Thanks to Hashirama's cells, Izanagi usage was extended for up to 60 seconds in a single Sharingan. While he could not see through or use the passive abilities of the Sharingan embedded in his arm, each eye extended his use of Izanagi, giving him up to 10 minutes of usage. As each had a set amount of time to maintain the technique, he would break its usage in between as he chooses to conserve time for later use.Naruto chapter 479, page 5 Obito explained that this length of time is due to the former's lack of mastery over Hashirama's cells.Naruto chapter 510, page 12 Also, even with Danzō's physical energy augmented by Hashirama's cells, it still took a substantial amount of chakra to sustain the technique. Mangekyō Sharingan Through Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, Danzō could use Kotoamatsukami, able to manipulate other people's thoughts without them being aware of it and make them act as if it was their natural choice. Because Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan circumvents the need to make eye-contact to activate its techniques,Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night, chapter 4 Danzō could make use of it without exposing it.Naruto chapter 459, pages 14-15 Normally, Kotoamatsukami is not a technique that can be used more than once a day. However, augmented by Hashirama's cells, Danzō could use it again after a few hours.Naruto chapter 480, page 11 He had expressed hope in increasing his ability to use this technique more frequently from Orochimaru's data.Naruto chapter 454, page 17 Upon his death, Danzō destroyed the eye in fear that it could one day be used against Konoha. Part II  Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission Danzō assigned Sai to Team Kakashi as part of a plan to secretly assassinate Sasuke Uchiha. To achieve that goal, Danzō had Sai make contact with Orochimaru in a ruse to make it seem he wanted to join forces with him to destroy Konoha. When Sai failed his mission but asked to remain with Team Kakashi, Danzō allowed him to do so while reminding the young man that emotions brought hatred, which in turn led to war. Twelve Guardian Ninja In the anime, Danzō was shown being followed by Anbu agents, on Tsunade's orders, when he was to be briefed by Tatsuji — a spy of his in Amegakure. He and Tatsuji were apprehended by the Anbu and later questioned by Tsunade, although the interrogation was interrupted by Sora, who was discovered eavesdropping. Pain's Assault Danzō ordering Root not to aid Konoha during the invasion.When Pain began his assault on Konoha, Tsunade asked the toad Kōsuke to retrieve Naruto Uzumaki from Mount Myōboku to help defend the village. In the anime, Danzō went to Homura and Koharu to tell them that Tsunade was risking the possible loss of the Fourth Hokage's legacy and the Nine-Tails by calling Naruto back. In the manga however, Danzō waited until everyone had left the room and killed Kōsuke in an attempt to stop Naruto from returning, Danzō then gathered his Root Anbu and instructed them not to aid Konoha in the hopes that Pain's actions would end Tsunade's reign as Hokage. When asked if all the villagers would not then die, Danzō denied this, claiming that Tsunade's medical abilities would save most of them.The Fire Daimyō and the Konoha delegation meet.Following the invasion, leaders of the Land of Fire and Konoha gathered for an emergency meeting. Here, despite Shikaku Nara's best efforts, Danzō convinced the daimyō that previous Hokage's peaceful ideologies had made Konoha weak and presented himself as the type of leader the village currently needed to enforce the laws of shinobi and bring order to the world. After brief consideration, the daimyō agreed to appoint him as Sixth Hokage Candidate. Five Kage Summit Danzō heading towards the Kage Summit.When Danzō returned from the meeting he received a letter from the Fourth Raikage, informing him of the approaching Kage Summit and the actions of Sasuke Uchiha. As his first order, Danzō ordered Sasuke's execution for treason marking him as a missing-nin. Although he would have preferred confining Naruto to protect the Nine-Tails, Danzō was aware of Naruto's new-found popularity in the village following his defeat of Pain and settled to have Naruto watched by his agents at all times to ensure he could be made an official Hokage. He also delayed Anko Mitarashi's assassination while ordering his men to find Kabuto Yakushi instead, who was in possession of medical information that could help with his right eye and arm. Danzō later departed for the Kage Summit with Torune Aburame and Fū Yamanaka as his bodyguards, revealing the Sharingan in his right eye socket when they were ambushed by remnant shinobi of the Land of Woods along the way.The five Kage meeting.Upon arrival in the Land of Iron and the meeting's start, Danzō did not actively participate other than reporting to the other Kage of \"Madara Uchiha\" was involved with Akatsuki. Mifune suggested that the five Kage form an alliance of their villages to eliminate Akatsuki with Danzō as its leader. As the Fourth Raikage accuses him and Akatsuki, rather than Orochimaru, of staging the Konoha Crush to dispose of Hiruzen and the Fourth Kazekage, Ao exposes Danzō's manipulating Mifune before White Zetsu appeared and revealed that Sasuke was nearby. As the Raikage left to eliminate Sasuke, with Ao instructed to keep an eye on Danzō, who explained to the remaining Kage that his ultimate goal was to unify the shinobi nations under one empire, ending the possibility of future war between them.When Sasuke arrived at their location, Danzō and his bodyguards used the opportunity to flee, with Ao in close pursuit. At some point during their escape, Danzō's party was beset by Black Zetsu's Spore Technique, but managed to dispatch the clones. Danzō ordered Fū to stop Ao, and emphasised that the retrieval of his Byakugan was a top priority. Fū managed to throw Ao off their trail, but failed to retrieve the Byakugan.Danzō fighting Sasuke.On their way back to Konoha, Danzō and his men were confronted by Tobi at the Samurai Bridge. Danzō instructed Fū and Torune to distract Tobi while he unsealed his right arm. Once Fū and Torune were defeated, Tobi brought out Sasuke. Danzō then revealed his right arm to show that it was embedded with Sharingan all over, and voiced his intent to add Tobi's and Sasuke's to his collection. Sasuke immediately questioned him about the Uchiha clan's assassination, hoping to find out if the Konoha elders really did force Itachi to murder his family. Danzō confirmed the story and questioned why Itachi would sacrifice peace to tell Sasuke the truth. Angry that Danzō spoke about his brother so casually, Sasuke crushed him with his Susanoo's hand.Sasuke and Danzō strike simultaneously.Despite his apparent death, Danzō was unharmed by Susanoo, as well as Sasuke's subsequent attacks. All the while Danzō goaded Sasuke by constantly talking about Itachi, prompting him to fully develop his Susanoo. Sasuke used Susanoo to fire an arrow at Danzō, who was forced to use his Wood Release to divert the attack. Tobi, having been observing the battle, surmised that his use of Sharingan and Wood Release must mean that he planned to control the Nine-Tails as well, and that he was using Izanagi, with the many Sharingan on his arm being sacrificed one-by-one to escape death. When he was finally reduced to one, Danzō and Sasuke each prepared one final attack; breathing wind-natured chakra onto a kunai creating a blade, Danzō prepared to clash with Sasuke's Chidori Sharp Spear.Sasuke stabs Karin and Danzō.Danzō believed that he had won and told Sasuke to go and join Itachi, before realising that Sasuke's genjutsu tricked him into thinking he has one more eye left to evade the impalement. His depleted chakra levels, coupled with his new injury, caused him to lose control of his wood abilities and he was forced to sever his arm before he was turned into a giant tree. Refusing to accept defeat, Danzō takes Karin as a hostage and prepared to use Shisui's eye before Sasuke extended his Chidori Sharp Spear through Karin to impale Danzo through the heart.Danzō's final attempt to eliminate Sasuke and Tobi.Dying, Danzō staggered towards Sasuke and Tobi, thinking about Hiruzen and lamenting how, no matter what he did, he could never match him, not even having officially becoming Hokage. With his last breath, he proclaimed that for the sake of the world and the safety of Konoha, he would take Sasuke and Tobi with him to the grave. He then activated the Reverse Four Symbols Sealing, but Sasuke and Tobi were able to get out of range. Danzō was, nevertheless, able to destroy Shisui's Sharingan in order to prevent Tobi from obtaining it. Legacy After Danzō's demise, Kakashi and Tsunade worked to tie up all loose ends, researching remaining Root facilities and members. However, not wanting the ex-Root members to become ostracised because of their history with him, the two Hokage chose not to publicly announce their final report. Also, one of Danzō's most loyal followers and top researchers, Tanuki Shigaraki, grew to resent the village for Danzō's death and by extension the disbanding of Root. Wanting revenge, he worked to complete his final project entrusted to him by Danzō, the Gozu Tennō, as a means for his goal.Boruto episode 13 In the anime, Danzō built a room in Root's base that could not be detected by the Byakugan, as a precaution against a possible Hyūga coup. The room was used to conceal Kawaki from Isshiki Ōtsutsuki when he attempted to rebrand him with a Kāma.Boruto episode 215In an ironic turn of events, Sasuke had later unwittingly taken up many of Danzō's traits during the Fourth Shinobi World War after deciding to protect the village, proclaiming that he would change the system of shinobi that he considers the source of all the chaos the ninja world has endured. After the war, though he remains acting mostly in the shadows, he is not as ruthless as Danzō. Video Games  Trivia Elements of Kishimoto's original concept for Itachi bear a resemblance to Danzō. Danzō's family name, Shimura, is written with the kanji for  and  and can be interpreted as \"I did it for the village,\" possibly hinting at Danzō's true intentions. Like Dan Katō, Danzō's name may be a reference to Katō Danzō, a noted ninja master during the time of the Sengoku period of Japan. Elements of Danzō's design and backstory, including the x-shaped scar on his chin and his status as the leader of Root, appear to have been taken from Masashi Kishimoto's original concept for Itachi Uchiha.Jin no Sho, page 380 Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Danzō show that he was 146cm around the time the Valley of the End was created, and 168cm when Tobirama died. In the Jin no Sho, summoning is not listed among Danzō's special characteristics. Also, despite his usage of Izanagi, Yang Release isn't listed as one of his natures. According to the databook(s): Danzō's hobbies were appreciating famous pictures, and keeping diaries. Danzō's favourite food and drink was hijiki (which he shared with his rival Hiruzen Sarutobi) and genmaicha (brown rice tea), while his least favourite was warabimochi (jelly-like confection). Danzō did not want to fight anyone in particular. Danzō's favourite word was . Quotes  (To Hiruzen) \"My father and grandfather died in battle as ninja. Self-sacrifice is a ninja's duty.\" (To Kinoe) \"The world of the shinobi is filled with a myriad of techniques. You cannot compete with just one power. We must master various techniques and use those powers to unite the shinobi world.\" (To Sai) \"Emotions lead one to hate… and hate leads one to conflict and war…\"Naruto chapter 310, page 12 (Danzō on not being well known in the ninja world) \"The ninja world is an ascetic world. To remain anonymous is a source of pride. But by controlling both the surface and underground, one can truly strengthen the village and nation. I will make certain that this summit is a success and that I am recognised as Hokage. Then the jōnin will have no choice but to accept me as Hokage. My era has finally come.\"Naruto chapter 456, page 8 (To Sasuke) \"Self sacrifice, that's what epitomises a shinobi. Never seeing the light of day, toiling in the shadows. That's the way of a true shinobi and not just Itachi. Countless shinobi have died the same way. This world could not function on ideals and pleasantries. It's thanks to people like him that peace has been maintained.\"Naruto chapter 476, page 19 (To Sasuke) \"Two brothers, whose abilities are identical. How could what your eyes perceive be so different. The truth about Itachi isn't important to you at all. Instead you simply want to destroy everything with your hatred. All you're doing is making the sacrifice of the Uchiha clan meaningless.\" (To Sasuke) \"It's not my life I'm worried about. This is for Konoha… for the ninja world… I can't die now… I'll… do anything… to survive. I… am the only one… who can change this world… this girl will be sacrificed for that.\"Naruto chapter 480, page 13 (Last words) \"Hiruzen… it looks like it's my turn next… but I… never did become Hokage… no matter how far I went I could never catch up with you… you are the leaves bathing in the sun. I… am the roots that grow in the dark. Hey, Hiruzen… what do you think of me? What am I to you…?\" \n",

      "is one of the last generation of Kirigakure's Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.Zai no Sho, page 33 He serves as the retainer of the Fifth Mizukage, before later becoming the  himself. Background In the anime, shortly after the Fourth Mizukage's passing and Mei Terumī was made the Fifth, Chōjūrō was present when the village received an invitation from Konohagakure and Sunagakure to join an impromptu Chūnin Exams they would be hosting together. Ao noted that the village was still recovering from the Fourth's passing, so it was decided the Kiri-nin would not take part in this event.Naruto: Shippūden episode 394 Personality Chōjūrō's new-found determination.Despite his membership in the elite Seven Swordsmen group, Chōjūrō is a shy individual and seems to lack confidence in his abilities. He also greatly respects and admires the Fifth Mizukage, as he commented inwardly on wanting to protect her \"beautiful smile\". By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Mei has noted that he has become a lot more confident in himself as seen when he cut down Black Zetsu without reservation and then declares to the Fifth that as a member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, he would guard the area with his life.Naruto chapter 562, page 10-12Years later after becoming the Sixth Mizukage, Chōjūrō has seemed to grow well into his new role, appearing much calmer and confident in his abilities. As a leader, he is patient and methodical, carefully observing the situation and considering the best way to approach it. At the same time, in the anime, is shown to still be with some doubts. Wanting so strongly to bring about a peaceful and happy era for his village, he struggles on how to deal with citizens who openly prefer the old traditions.Boruto episode 29 Despite his continued doubts, he remains selfless, willing to take on any personal harm to seek success.Boruto episode 30 Even when grieving over the loss of a dear ally, he remains composed enough to value the lives of his other allies and hoping to settle things peacefully,Boruto episode 251 while also remaining pragmatic to prepare for a likely conflict.Boruto episode 252 Appearance Chōjūrō in Part II.Chōjūrō has short, tufty blue hair, and dark eyes. He also has pointed, shark-like teeth; a common trait of the members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist as well as apprentices share. He wears square, black-rimmed glasses connected to ear protectors, a blue pin-striped shirt and camouflage pattern pants.He wears his forehead protector on the front of his holster which he uses to carry Hiramekarei. The sword itself is wrapped in bandages leaving only the double hilt visible. He also has shuriken holsters strapped onto each of his legs. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he still wears the same outfit but changed his forehead protector to that of the Alliance's. Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Chōjūrō grew noticeably taller and developed a firmer jawline with some chin stubble. He started wearing glasses with thicker frames and the ear-protectors he wore changed design. He retained his overall attire, but the straps of his sword-holster now only covers his left shoulder. Chōjūrō now also wears his light-grey pants without the dual shuriken holsters. Abilities Despite his meek demeanour, Chōjūrō is a highly capable ninja, earning acceptance into the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, and being chosen as one of the Fifth Mizukage's bodyguards during the Kage Summit. Due to being part of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, Chōjūrō's skills were already considered some of the strongest in the entire village, showing he had great potential. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he proved able to defeat Black Zetsu while fighting alongside his allies. Years later, Chōjūrō's abilities improved immensely as he was promoted to the rank of Sixth Mizukage. Even against multiple wielders of the Seven Mist Swords, Chōjūrō is able to systematically defeat his foes. While working alongside the Fifth Kazekage or Fourth Tsuchikage, he was able to hold his own even against enemies as strong as the Ōtsutsuki Clan.Boruto episode 62Boruto episode 64 Kenjutsu & Physical Prowess Chōjūrō wielding Hiramekarei. Chōjūrō is referred as a master swordsman, even amongst the other Seven Mist Swordsmen.Naruto Shippūden episode 266 Amongst the Five Kage, he is rumoured to be the best swordsman and assassin.Boruto: Naruto the Movie novelAs a kenjutsu practitioner, Chōjūrō wields a dual-handled sword called Hiramekarei, that is linked together at the handles by a chain. When released from its bandages, it releases the chakra stored in it and shape weapons, such as an enormous hammer, capable of sending Sasuke flying through a wall despite being shielded by Susanoo, as well as a massive longsword, capable of taking out several targets simultaneously.Naruto chapter 466, page 4 As Mizukage, he could fire a detached long-ranged chakra blade with a swing of Hiramekarei, create a copy of it with chakra for dual wielding, as well as create several knives strong enough to immobilise opponents.Boruto: Naruto the MovieAs Mizukage, his skills in kenjutsu allowed him to fight on par with Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, and is regarded as having no equal while wielding Hiramekarei.Boruto episode 24 In the anime, even without Hiramekarei, Chōjūrō remained a fierce battler, armed only with a standard katana. Against the self-proclaimed New Seven Ninja Swordsmen, wielding three of the signature weapons, Chōjūrō proved very resilient, easily taking multiple puncture wounds and breaking free from his wire-bindings. Once on the offence, he seamlessly overpowered the foes with mightier weapons using only a broken sword. He also showed considerable strength, able to easily hold up Kubikiribōchō with a single hand. Ninjutsu  Nature Transformation Chōjūrō utilising Water Release.In the anime, Chōjūrō is highly skilled in Water Release, able to perform them with few-to-no hand signs and little need of already-existing water. If he's without an actual sword, he can create a blade of water to work as a replacement, as well as produce a massive water surge from underground to catch an opponent off guard and subdue them. He can also produce a barrage of water bullets to assault his enemies.Boruto episode 246 Part II  Five Kage Summit The Kage's bodyguards on the offensive.Chōjūrō and Ao were chosen to escort the Fifth Mizukage to the Kage Summit. During their trip to the Land of Iron, Chōjūrō was frequently embarrassed by the Mizukage's concern over him, which earned him scolding from Ao. Once they finally arrived and the meeting began, Ao and Chōjūrō rushed to her defence during the Fourth Raikage's outburstNaruto chapter 458, pages 4-5 and later White Zetsu's appearance at the Summit.Naruto chapter 459, pages 16-17 Chōjūrō attacks Sasuke.When Sasuke Uchiha infiltrated the conference hall, Chōjūrō activated Hiramekarei and formed it into a hammer which he used to knock Sasuke into a sealed off, adjacent hall where the Mizukage could fight him alone. Although Sasuke was able to escape, his actions convinced the Kage to begin working together. When Tobi appeared and told the attendees of his Eye of the Moon Plan, Chōjūrō silently listened on and later after the masked man had left, as a sign of good faith, Chōjūrō told those in attendance about Kisame Hoshigaki and his Samehada but was cut off by Ōnoki who stated that they were already aware of this information.Naruto chapter 468, pages 8-9After leaving the Summit with Mei, they followed Ao, who was tracking Danzō and his delegation. When they finally caught up with Ao, the Mizukage was able to stop Ao from seemingly beheading himself. She realised that he was under enemy control, and requested to use Hiramekarei to force him out. Fū insulted her upon learning that she knew he wasn't really Ao, and she quickly punched Ao before realising that the opponent had already released the technique. Later, when they return to Kirigakure they are informed that the daimyō had approved the formation of the Shinobi Alliance. Paradise Life on a Boat In the anime, Chōjūrō was sent by the Mizukage in a diplomatic mission to better Kirigakure's relationship with Iwagakure, along with Kurotsuchi and Akatsuchi who were also sent by the Third Tsuchikage on the same mission to stop Ganryū in the process. Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation Chōjūrō attended the last meeting that was held by the Alliance in order to fully prepare for the upcoming war. The Mizukage told him to contact Ao in the Sensor Division and tell him that they needed to hurry. Chōjūrō later joined Mei in guarding the various daimyō during war. When Black Zetsu located the daimyō, he, Genma Shiranui, and Raidō Namiashi, as well as the other members, confronted the Akatsuki member.Chōjūrō cuts down Black Zetsu.As the battle between the two sides waged on throughout the night, one of Naruto Uzumaki's shadow clones arrived to help in the battle. During the fight one Black Zetsu's branches caught Naruto's foot, causing his Rasenshuriken attack to miss. Chōjūrō used that opportunity to attack from behind with his Hiramekarei. Forming it into a longsword, he cuts through Black Zetsu, and stated that the more confident he was, the stronger his strike. He then pinned Black Zetsu to the ground with the tip of his sword and told Mei — who was being called away — to deal with the reincarnated Madara Uchiha and that as one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist he would defend that point with his life. Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes Naruto and Sasuke eventually release the Infinite Tsukuyomi, freeing Chōjūrō and the rest of the world and thus ending the Fourth Shinobi World War. Blank Period  Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness Chōjūrō participating in the Shinobi Union.With the Allied Shinobi Forces disbanding in the aftermath of the Fourth Shinobi World War, the Shinobi Union is formed, with Chōjurō representing his village. During one such meeting, Chōjurō gave a report about the missing shinobi after the war. The Last: Naruto the Movie Two years following the Fourth Shinobi World War, after meteors began frequently hitting the planet, a Kage Summit was convened. Chōjūrō accompanied the Fifth Mizukage to it. Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise Chōjūrō helps the Fifth Mizukage protect Kiri from the exploding humans. New Era Chōjūrō captures Araumi.Chōjūrō eventually succeeds Mei and became the Sixth Mizukage. Upon recently becoming a Kage, he and Misuno attend a Five Kage Summit in Konohagakure. During the meeting Sasuke came forth to reveal evidence of a new White Zetsu Army being formed and a potential threat even greater than Kaguya. Ultimately, it was agreed to keep this information a secret from the public and allow Sasuke to continue his research and further investigate his sources. In the anime, five years prior to Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's defeat, Chōjūrō led a mission to capture Araumi Funato, leading to the pirate's clan falling into disarray and allowing trades on the sea to resume safely. During another summit held in Konoha, Chōjūrō comments on how the Hokage is late for a summit held in his own village. School Trip Arc Chōjūrō welcomes Konoha's Academy students to Kirigakure.In the anime, to improve relationships with other villages and symbolically show the warring era was over, Naruto set up an official class trip for the Academy to go to Kirigakure. He worked out the details with Chōjūrō, who assigned Kagura Karatachi as a tour guide for the class. The next day, as Kagura continued to grow closer to the Konoha-nin, an improve in outlook made Kagura request the Sixth Mizukage to take the test to claim Hiramekarei. Later, Chōjūrō and Mei learned that Kagura had joined Shizuma Hoshigaki's team and helped them steal all the Seven Mist Swordsmen's blades. While the Sixth Mizukage was strongly considering killing them all for the treachery, Boruto insisted that Kagura was not truly a traitor, but being manipulated. Boruto also insisted to treat this as a children's fight so as to not make a public scene. Chōjūrō agreed to this on the condition that he join them in ending the revolt and if it was completed before curfew. Chōjūrō facing Kyohō.They found the rebellious group at the Kiri Memorial where Shizuma's team was about to destroy it, seeing it as an insult to Kirigakure's pride. As the fight began, Chōjūrō was subdued by the Nuibari. The group voiced their disdain at Chōjūrō, feeling that his efforts for peace were a disgrace to their heritage as ninja and that Chōjūrō was trying to erase the very memory of the fiercest ninja in Kirigakure's history. Chōjūrō did concede to some of their words, voicing his true regret at now being able to make everyone pleased with this modernisation. The group rejected his apology and attacked him with three of the Mist Blades. Chōjūrō anticipated their attack patterns and used it to break free. While his foes scoffed at Chōjūrō facing them with only a standard katana, Chōjūrō retorted that a weapon is only as powerful as its wielders. Proving his point, he continued to exploit the revolutionaries' key weakness and defeated them. After restraining all them, he went to deal with Shizuma. He arrived to see the rebellious ninja being absorbed by Samehada. He explained to the Konoha-nin that Samehada's ravenous nature makes it so only the most experienced of wielders should attempt usage of it. In his imperfect shark-form, Shizuma went on a feral rampage. While Chōjūrō asked Kagura for Hiramekarei, Kagura wished to fix this mistake personally. Together with Boruto, the two were able to separate Shizuma from Samehada and end the rebellion. Afterwards, Shizuma and his team were sent to prison for rehabilitation. Expanding on Boruto's idea of lessening the severity of the situation, Chōjūrō decided to cover it up in fear of the news spreading leading to the regress of the village to its darker times. He later saw off the Konoha class as they returned home. Chōjūrō then began giving Kagura special training to help him overcome his insecurities at drawing a sword. Realising how full of shame Kagura was for his actions, he insisted to talk to Boruto and apologise with honesty, knowing that the boy would forgive Kagura. Versus Momoshiki Arc Chōjūrō attacks Urashiki.Chōjūrō attended the Chūnin Exams and sat with the other Kage during the third round. During which, the village was attacked by members of the Ōtsutsuki Clan, Momoshiki, Kinshiki, and, in the anime, Urashiki. During which, Chōjūrō aided Gaara in attempted to subdue Urashiki, only for the foe to escape. After the attack ended, Naruto was captured by the foes. Chōjūrō, the other Kage, Sasuke and Boruto decided to rescue him. Chōjūrō and Kurotsuchi restraining Kinshiki.After being transported to the dimension where Naruto was, Sasuke battled Momoshiki while he and the other Kage fight Kinshiki off. During the battle, he restrained Kinshiki from moving after Sasuke destroyed his weapon, allowing Kurotsuchi to capture him. However, he later manages to break free and let himself get absorbed by Momoshiki. Momoshiki then later proceeded to capture Chōjūrō and the other Kage in his shadow jutsu before Boruto threw his Vanishing Rasengan to free them. With Sasuke's help, Boruto managed to defeat Momoshiki with a giant Rasengan. After Momoshiki's defeat, Chōjūrō posed for a photograph with the other Kage, Sasuke and Boruto.In the anime, after Konohagakure recovered from the Ōtsutsuki attack, a Kage Summit was held. Chōjūrō and the other retired Kage were in attendant to discuss the still looming threat of the Ōtsutsuki. Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc In the anime, Chōjūrō attended Ōnoki's funeral. Shikamaru Shinden: A Cloud Dancing in Forlorn Falling Petals Chōjūrō and Misuno attended a Kage Summit in Konoha at the Hokage building, during which the Kage bickered about topics concerning Konoha, leading to Kurotsuchi demanding Konoha to disclose all of its confidential information as the village's proof to peace by the next summit, and said Iwagakure would leave the Five Great Shinobi Country alliance if they didn't. After the demand, the summit ended. Kara Actuation Arc In the anime, Rock Lee was sent to Kiri as a messenger to inform Chōjūrō of the threat of Kara. Kawaki Arc When Team 7 found a mysterious boy with connections to Kara, Naruto called forth a Kage Summit. As talks about the boy's fate began, it was unanimously decided to treat the boy with sympathy as they were no strangers to children being made into weapons (i.e. jinchūriki). It was also agreed for the boy to live with Naruto, who would watch over him at all times, which Kurotsuchi was impressed at how much multi-tasking Naruto could do through his shadow clones. Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc Chōjūrō hands Hiramekarei to Kagura.In the anime, sometime after Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's defeat, Kirigakure hosted a ceremony that invited various scientists and dignitaries from around the world to witness the unveiling of their new power plants that both generated great amounts of electricity, but also controlled the raging nature of the ocean. Security was tight due to rumours of an attack. Chōjūrō spoke on the ceremony, and organised the audience to be flown to visit the Shinonome 1 power station. However, one of the airships carrying industrialists crashed and exploded. Chōjūrō put out the fires in coordination with other Kiri-nin. He ordered the area to be put in lock-down to prevent potential suspects from escaping before they could be investigated. He later learned the attack on the airship was a distraction by the Funato Clan, so they could break out their leader Araumi Funato from prison. Unable to spare the man-power, he allowed Kagura to aid Team 7, recruiting Buntan Kurosuki, Hebiichigo, and Kyohō Fuefuki from prison. He handed Kagura Hiramekarei, and allowed the released swordsmen access to the blades, though they were branded with cursed seals.Later, with the Funato Clan's continued expansion, with many Land of Water citizens joining them, Chōjūrō was forced to leave the village and join the front-lines. Soon, Chōjūrō met the Funato main fleet, and demanded their surrender. He remained concerned even as Misuno reported that the Funato forces remained on the defensive. When he received Kagura's message about the Funato fleet being a diversion, he chose to feign ignorance not to alert them. By nightfall, Tenma Funato attempted to infiltrate their ship with a small team to assassinate him, but Chōjūrō anticipated it, and prepared an ambush of his own. The Kirigakure forces overpowered Tenma's group until only Tenma remained. He offered to spare Tenma if he revealed the Funato's goals, but Tenma attacked, forcing Chōjūrō to cut him down. He had their fleet attack the Funato fleet, prompting their retreat.Chōjūrō is protected by Misuno.Later, Misuno notified him of Kagura's and Hebiichigo's death in action. Kagura's death in particular hit him hard, having wished for Kagura to be Mizukage one day, and firmly declared his desire to wipe out the Funato. He was notified that Isari Funato had reached out, wishing to negotiate. Misuno questioned why he'd be willing to negotiate with the Funato, and Chōjūrō explained that while he has no personal problems eradicating them, prolonging the conflict would only result in more casualties. Isari and Jibiki were brought him, restrained, but Isari broke free of his, wishing to negotiate as an equal. Despite the tension, they agreed to talk, but were interrupted by Araumi's broadcast, announcing an all-out attack. Chōjūrō questioned Isari's presence, though Jibiki vouched for him. When Araumi declared that not even relatives would be spared if they stood against him, the Marlin Harpoon came alive and skewered Isari, before attempting to do the same to Chōjūrō. The harpoon was cut down by Misuno. Upon learning that the Funato intended to attack the Shinonome 1 power station, and were taking the shortest, but dangerous Sea of Death route to get to it, he ordered that all ships that could intercept them set sail.As the Kirigakure forces prepared to defend the Shinonome 1, Team 7 arrived by boat to return Kagura's Hiramekarei to Chōjūrō. They voiced their desire to end the war with no more bloodshed. While sympathising with their desire for peace, Chōjūrō revealed that Araumi was so driven for war and conquest, he even killed Isari when he tried to broker peace. As Chōjūrō insisted that they must protect the Shinonome 1, Boruto noted that the Funato's goal of conquest seemed to originally be sparked from rejection of the Shinonome 1, a construct that many in the Land of Water were openly against. Boruto insisted that he could get through to Ikada Funato, who was their friend before joining the war. Reluctantly, Chōjūrō agreed to give Boruto some time to meet with the Funato. In the event of failure, Chōjūrō began galvanising his forces for war. As Team 7 approached the Funato ships, Chōjūrō and Misuno listened in through their ship's instruments. Misuno wasn't surprised by their hostility and asked Chōjūrō what they should do, him telling her Team 7 still had more time. He was shocked when the Funato mobile fortress appeared, its Chakra Cannon charging a shot at the Shinonome 1. Chōjūrō was even more shocked when Boruto willingly offered his own life in order to stop the war. Though Chōjūrō became concerned for Boruto, he couldn't allow the Funato make their first move and told Misuno to prepare an attack on the Funato mobile fortress. He also commented Boruto's determination became merely naïve and that would not stop the war. However, after Team 7's genuine actions made Ikada save Boruto from drowning, and he and his men abandoned their hatred toward Kirigakure and withdrew, Chōjūrō was ashamed for dismissing Boruto's determination and twisting Kagura's wishes because of his own hatred, admitting he still had much to learn.Chōjūrō and Misuno discuss the aftermath of the Funato war.In the aftermath, Chōjūrō received a report of the damages, as well as a request by the Water Daimyō to deliver harsh punishment to the Funato commanders Araumi and Ikada. He and Misuno discussed the situation and lives that were lost, and he concluded that the too quick modernisation was responsible for much of the Funato support. The development of the Shinonome project was suspended, so they could get support from the entire country. He delivered Ikada's sentence of constant surveillance, placing him under Kajiki's watch. Due to Team 5's and Team 7's involvement in the conflict, he notified Konoha of these developments. Code's Assault Arc Following the defeat of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki, Naruto had a Kage Summit set up via video. The other Kage were caught up on the newest developments. Chōjūrō asked what the goals were of the last remaining Inner, Code. They speculated that Code, as a devout follower of Isshiki, would seek to kill all those responsible for killing Isshiki, and completing the growth of the Ten-Tails. As everyone was concerned to hear about a new Ten-Tails, they asked what Naruto would do with his son if Momoshiki took over Boruto completely through the Kāma. Naruto swore he would handle the matter as it was needed to be done. In Other Media  Video Games Chōjūrō is a support-only character in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, and Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. Creation and Conception Wanting to create a younger character, Masashi Kishimoto gave Chōjūrō short hair and attire that was not that of the standard shinobi. Then wanting to give him an air of unreliability, he immediately gave him glasses. The jagged teeth, Kishimoto admits, was simply an indulgence on his part. Trivia   is a red-coloured cultivar of the \"Asian pear\"; like all members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen, his name is derived from a type of produce. In the anime, it is revealed that Chōjūrō dislikes oily foods.Naruto: Shippūden episode 218 Despite the time of Chōjūrō's inauguration being unknown, he had recently become a Kage at the time of the Five Great Shinobi Countries co-sponsorship Chūnin Exams. Quotes  (About the Fifth Mizukage) \"She's so kind. I will do everything to protect that smile on our gentle Mizukage. I hope I can.\"Naruto chapter 454, page 7 (After cutting down Black Zetsu) \"The more confident you are the stronger the strike. I had to cut him down anyway…\" \n",

      "This is a secret taijutsu of the Hyūga clan's main house, traditionally only known by the head of the clan and the clan's heir. Neji Hyūga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. Using their Byakugan's near-360° field of vision, the Hyūga envisions themselves within the centre of an Eight Trigrams symbol. The user then delivers a series of attacks to a target that is within the symbol's perimeter, striking sixty-four of their tenketsu. Those sixty-four tenketsu are subsequently blocked, stopping the flow of chakra within the target's body and making it difficult for them to move. Alternatively, the sixty-four strikes can be split amongst multiple targets, such as to to deflect incoming projectiles.Naruto chapter 195The sixty-four strikes are broken into six smaller sets. Users perform each set of strikes within the same length of time, but because each set has more strikes than the one before it, the set's strikes become increasingly faster. The last set, during which thirty-two strikes are performed, is especially difficult, demanding great resolve and a strong step forward to pull off.Naruto chapter 633 As targets are struck, they are increasingly knocked backwards, with the combined force of the final sets being great enough to push them through tree trunks.Naruto chapter 194 The six sets of strikes are:Two consecutive strikes.Two more consecutive strikes, totalling four.Four consecutive strikes, totalling eight.Eight consecutive strikes, totalling sixteen.Sixteen consecutive strikes, totalling thirty-two.Thirty-two consecutive strikes, totalling sixty four. Trivia  In the anime, Shira was able to block all sixty-four strikes because of his speed and taijutsu skill.Naruto: Shippūden episode 400 See Also  Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms \n",

      "Sukunahikona is a dōjutsu of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's unspecified right eye. It allows him to instantaneously shrink himself or any nonliving matter within his gaze and return it to its original size at will. Overview Sukunahikona allows the user to shrink themselves and targets within the user sight, even energy and other chakra-based substances, though living beings other than the user cannot be affected. Because the change in size happens too fast for the human eye to see, it is often mistaken for teleportation. It cannot be used on oneself if they are physically paralysed. Daikokuten can be used to store shrunken objects within a dimension where time doesn't flow, allowing them to maintain their condition.Isshiki Ōtsutsuki utilised this jutsu while on the verge of death after being betrayed by Kaguya to enter the body of Jigen, which allowed him to survive as a parasite before taking over his brain.Isshiki employs this technique in combat by shrinking his projectile attacks to keep his enemies from defending against them and then restoring them to their original size to inflict critical damage. He also uses it to dodge enemy attacks and free himself from restraints. He is still able to use Kāma's absorption while shrunk himself. He could also use this defensively against what Kāma cannot absorb, such as reducing natural flames that were burning him. The shrinkage is not limited to an object's entirety, as Isshiki can shrink a section of the target object, such as causing a building to cave in or remove a section of a rooftop.While inhabiting Jigen’s body, this technique normally required hand gestures in order to shrink foreign matter, but in his original form, Isshiki can achieve the effect just by looking at desired objects. Trivia  This technique appears to be inspired by Sukonabikona, the son of a goddess of creation whose name means \"small lord of renown\", a dwarf no bigger than a \n",

      "300pxThe  is a planetary body orbiting Earth. It was created a millennium ago by Hamura and Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the former of which gave it its name.The Last: Naruto the Movie novel History The moon being created.The Moon was created by Hagoromo and his brother, Hamura, when they sealed their mother, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, with Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei. After the Moon's creation, Hamura took leadership of the Ōtsutsuki clan and settled on the Moon in order to guard the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path inside.Fourth Databook, pages 216-217 Hagoromo asked Hamura to monitor mankind, a task that was passed to the rest of the Ōtsutsuki when Hamura died. Over time, a civil war broke out between the main and branch families over ideologies, which drove Hamura's clan to near extinction and his message became misguided: if mankind was deemed unworthy, they were to be destroyed.The Last: Naruto the MovieThe moon reflecting the Infinite Tsukuyomi.Centuries later, sometime prior to the Second Shinobi World War, Madara Uchiha summoned the Demonic Statue from the Moon with his Rinnegan, intent on using it to bring peace to the world.Naruto chapter 606, page 13 In order to achieve this goal, Madara came up with the Eye of the Moon Plan, wherein the Ten-Tails would be revived and its jinchūriki would cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi on the Moon, thereby ending all conflicts by trapping the world in a perpetual dream.Naruto chapter 467 Fulfilment of much of the plan ultimately falls to Obito Uchiha upon Madara's death, though Madara is revived in time to see the plan completed during the Fourth Shinobi World War. The Infinite Tsukuyomi is later broken by the combined efforts of Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha.The Moon, cut in half by Toneri Ōtsutsuki.Two years after the war, the last surviving member of the Ōtsutsuki clan's branch family, Toneri Ōtsutsuki, began moving the Moon toward the Earth so that he could destroy it and rebuild a purer world from the ashes. As the Moon began breaking up in the Earth's gravity and increasingly raining meteors upon its surface, Konohagakure sent a team to rescue Hanabi Hyūga, eventually ending up on the Moon. Toneri was eventually defeated by Naruto and Hamura's actual mission was afterwards explained to him by Hinata Hyūga. Apologetic, Toneri restored the Moon to its previous orbit and, despite an invitation to live on the Earth, stayed on the Moon, vowing that it would never threaten the world again. Environment The exterior of the Moon is barren, covered with craters and canyons. It has a weak gravity, but is still able to maintain a breathable atmosphere inside the Moon. Despite its harsh conditions, the Ōtsutsuki were able to settle on the Moon due to their unique anatomy and physiology. To improve its habitability and allow their population to thrive, the Ōtsutsuki built the Tenseigan at the centre of the Moon, granting them light, powering their equipment, and allowing them to control the Moon's movements. Similar to a Dyson sphere, they created a vast environment on the Moon's interior surface, complete with oceans, mountains, forests, and various animal species, however this environment was far smaller than the full size of the Moon itself. The full size is unknown, but its at least as big as a small country. Several villages were built across the landscape, which were steadily abandoned as the Ōtsutsuki's population dwindled.The artificial sun at the centre of the Moon created by the Tenseigan is actually a barrier, within which are housed various important sites, such as Hamura's shrine, the Tenseigan itself, and a castle where Toneri lives. All are guarded by an army of puppets, controllable without chakra threads because of the Tenseigan, as well as the golem created by Toneri.There is at least one portal that enables travel from the Earth to the Moon and back. Located underground, the portal itself takes the form of a spring of green water, though contact with the water doesn't leave one wet. By entering the portal, one travels through a dimension filled with various orbs, some of which are earthen in composition, others trap those who contact them in their own memories. At the Moon's end of the portal is the Gatekeeper, a giant crab that prevents unauthorised access. This portal collapses shortly after Toneri's defeat. Trivia Gaara's destructiveness and blood-lust was heightened during a full moon. The anime often depicts the Moon as red during significant events. There have been cases that both the tailed beasts and their jinchūriki are affected to a certain degree during a full Moon: According to Gaara, Shukaku's blood-lust is especially strong during a full Moon.Naruto chapter 91, page 19 In the anime, Blue B, during his time as Gyūki's jinchūriki, noted that he would have trouble sleeping during the nights of the full Moon, because anytime he would stare at it, it would reflect the loneliness in his heart. Gyūki would take advantage of those moments of weakness and try to control over Blue B's body. Blue B was also shown to take sleeping pills to help with this side-effect.Naruto: Shippūden episode 318 An early account of the story given in the series, Hagoromo alone is said to have created the Moon at the end of his life, using it to store the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path so that the Ten-Tails could never be reborn.  There are two other known moons that exist in the Naruto universe, both of which are located in Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's dimensions. The first, which is located in the core dimension, was created by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha after they managed to seal Kaguya for a second time. The second moon is located in the icy realm, and the circumstances in how it was created are unknown. In the anime, when Kaguya first cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi, she used a moon from an unidentified location, by opening a portal to another dimension. \n",

      "The  is an Outer Path technique that allows a Rinnegan user to manipulate up to six bodies as though they are their own. Usage The user embeds one or more black receivers into a body, allowing them to channel their chakra into it from great distances. To make full use of the body, the user ideally transmits their chakra from the highest and closest point possible so that they can have the best possible range.Naruto chapter 428, pages 14-15 Once their chakra enters the body, they are given complete control of it, allowing them to decide all of its actions, its use of jutsu, and even speak through it. As a representation of this control, the controlled bodies' eyes take on the same appearance as the user's.Naruto chapter 544, pages 16-17 Inoichi Yamanaka compared this technique to the Yamanaka clan's Mind Body Switch Technique, albeit on a greater scale.A first-person perspective of the Rinnegan's shared vision.When multiple bodies are controlled together the user is able to see through all of their eyes, thus registering six separate fields of vision at the same time. With this shared vision, the user can coordinate their attacks and provide defences for their blind spots. For this reason, the Six Paths of Pain are strongest when used together, employing combination tactics, the element of surprise, and/or sheer overwhelming power to defeat their enemies.The technique has a drawback. If the caster of the technique is interrupted in any way while transmitting chakra to the bodies being used as part of the technique, then all of the bodies will stop moving and become very vulnerable to attack. Nagato's Paths Nagato's Six Paths of Pain (with a new Animal Path).Nagato created the Six Paths of Pain after he was left crippled during a battle with Hanzō. Unable to move or act on his own, he controlled six corpses to carry out his will as part of his \"Pain\" identity.Naruto chapter 443, page 3 In the anime, the first body used, belonged to his childhood friend Yahiko,Naruto: Shippūden episode 348 which was his favourite. To match his late friend's hair colour, he had the other Paths' hair dyed to the same colour, including eyebrows. Nagato's first Six Paths of Pain were composed of individuals that Jiraiya had met when they were alive. Nagato implants their black receivers all over their bodies as body piercings.Each of the Six Paths of Pain can be used to perform any technique that Nagato himself is capable of, however, he limits each body to one branch of the Six Paths Techniques, the exception being Yahiko's body (the Deva Path) through which he performs a number of miscellaneous jutsu; the King of Hell and the creatures summoned by the Animal Path are part of his shared vision. Nagato refers to each body by the Path it embodies and has them serve specific purposes, be it offensive or defensive, reconnaissance or repair. Each of the Paths has its own importance in a fight – the Naraka Path's ability to restore all the other Paths making it the most valuable – and therefore, Nagato will sacrifice other Paths to protect those further up the hierarchy.Because of his lack of mobility, Nagato requires a great deal of preparation time to use his Six Paths of Pain, especially when moving outside his usual residence in Amegakure. Some of the Six Paths Techniques are very chakra-taxing, and in order to use them Nagato must either bring the respective body closer to his positionNaruto chapter 438, page 17 or alternatively cut off control of the other five Paths and focus all of his chakra into the one.Naruto chapter 429, page 10 The greatest weakness of his Six Paths of Pain is that each body has only one primary ability; if an enemy has prior knowledge of what body does what, they stand a better chance of defeating the Paths. Sensors can track the chakra Nagato spends to control the paths back to him, exposing his real location. This is usually mitigated by Nagato's frequent changing of his chakra signature. It took Naruto stabbing himself with one of Nagato's black receivers to create a direct connection to track him with his Sage Mode sensing.The room where the bodies are kept.When not in use, Nagato stores the bodies in a hidden chamber within Amegakure's tallest tower. Within the room are six \"pods\", in which the bodies rested; each pod is connected to the wall via pipes or wires and has a sliding cover that appears to feature the symbol of Amegakure, which conceals the face of the inactive body. The pods are also numbered from one through six using daiji characters and are ordered counter-clockwise around the room with a numbering scheme that corresponds with the ordering of the six Buddhist Paths of Reincarnation:  - Deva Path.  - Asura Path.   - Human Path.   - Animal Path.  - Preta Path.   - Naraka Path. Obito's Paths Obito's Six Paths in partial transformations.Obito Uchiha creates his own Six Paths of Pain during the Fourth Shinobi World War using the reincarnated jinchūriki.Naruto chapter 544, pages 16-17 Obito controls his Six Paths using a single black receiver embedded into the left side of each of their chests, which were hidden from view. When transformed into the tailed beast, the receivers move from the chest to the neck. He also seals their respective tailed beast back into their bodies, which he maintains control of through the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.Naruto chapter 570, pages 2-4 Obito forcing the jinchūriki into their full tailed beast forms.Obito can force the jinchūriki to transform into their full Tailed Beast Modes, but this carries an increased risk of the beasts subverting his commands.Naruto chapter 567, pages 7-9 Because of how much effort it requires to keep six tailed beasts under his control at once, Obito does not channel the Six Paths Techniques into his Six Paths of Pain.Naruto chapter 567, page 14 Rather, he uses the same abilities that they had when they were alive, such as Rōshi's Lava Release and Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu. With Obito's Sharingan, through which he sees what his Paths see, he is able to more precisely synchronise and deploy their abilities.Naruto chapter 565, page 9 Influences Based upon the six Buddhist Paths of Reincarnation, each body was named after one of the different Paths: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these Paths, or realms, represents one of the realms a being is reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives. While the two lower Paths, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher Paths, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be Paths of suffering because they perpetuate the cycle of Reincarnation; the only way to break it and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment. Trivia  In the anime, Nagato's Six Paths spoke in Yahiko's voice, with the exception of Nagato's second Animal Path. The latter had a female voice as it was a woman. Three of Nagato's Six Paths of Pain are playable in Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, while the other three appear as support characters. All six are able to appear simultaneously in three-versus-one match-ups. The playable ones are Deva, Asura and Animal, the ones whose primary function is battle, rather than support. While talking to Tobi about the Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation technique, Kabuto Yakushi uses the term  to refer to the six bodies Nagato used to fight Jiraiya.Naruto chapter 520 See Also  Dead Soul Technique Nine Masked Beasts \n",

      "Synopsis Using his ink mice, Sai locates Kabuto hiding out in one of Orochimaru's old hideouts. Before he can go in, Tokuma Hyūga and his squad arrive, notifying captain Anko that Sai was to return to Konoha immediately while they take his place in the Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party. Anko asks what happened, due to the fact that Yamato had left abruptly and stated it was an emergency. Tokuma reveals that the Akatsuki mounted an attack on the village and that it was destroyed, and that due to Tsunade's coma, Danzō had been appointed Hokage.Meanwhile, Team Samui make their way to Konoha, surprised at its destruction. Samui takes the Fourth Raikage's letter to Tsunade, only to discover that Tsunade is in a coma. She demands to see the acting Hokage, and Danzō enters the tent and proclaim himself as the village's Sixth Hokage. The letter requests that the village take action on missing-nin Sasuke Uchiha and to hand over all intel gathered on him. Danzō agrees, and passes down an official order to eliminate Sasuke.Sai is told by Danzō to keep an eye on Naruto, whom he promises not to harm at the moment due to the fact that Naruto is viewed as the village's hero. Kiba finds Naruto, Sakura and Kakashi, who are about to leave the village, and relays what has transpired. Naruto and Sakura attempt to extract information from Sai regarding Danzō, but Sai reveals that he has a cursed seal on his tongue that prevents him from doing so. He tells the duo that all members of Root are branded with the seal to eradicate any attempts of interrogation should they be captured. Naruto asks Sai why Danzō has called out for Sasuke's assassination, which shocks Sai since he was not made aware of the fact. The mention of Sasuke's name has the trio held at sword point by Karui and Omoi, who stuns them by revealing that Sasuke kidnapped their master and is a member of the Akatsuki. As Sakura begins to cry, the two Kumo-nin berate them for not being able to understand what it feels like to know that their master may have been killed. Recalling how he felt when Jiraiya died, Naruto asks whether their master is a jinchūriki, much to their shock. Naruto tells them that the Akatsuki capture jinchūriki alive and therefore their master is not dead yet, and notifies them that he is a jinchūriki as well. He agrees to help them look for their master, and Karui accepts his offer, asking him to debrief them about Sasuke on the way.Elsewhere, Taka continue on their path towards Konoha, only to be blocked by Madara. Sasuke tells Madara that Taka has left the Akatsuki, but Madara explains that they blundered in their attempt to catch the Eight-Tails and thus must make amends. His associate, Zetsu, appears and notifies Madara that Danzō has been made Hokage, much to Sasuke's indignation, since Danzō was one of Konoha's elders who forced Itachi to massacre his own clan. Madara reveals that Konoha had been destroyed by Pain while Zetsu notifies the group that a Five Kage Summit has been called. Credits pl:Szósty Hokage Danzō\n",

      "was an elder of Konohagakure. As the founder and leader of Root, Danzō gained notoriety as Naruto chapter 459, page 1 because of his frequent unsanctioned actions and his often-suspected (but rarely proven) undermining of specific Konoha personnel. Despite his decades of suspicious deeds, Danzō only ever acted in what he believed were the village's best interests. He was appointed the Kai no Sho page 116 after Pain's Assault, but died before he could be formally approved to the position. Background Born into the Shimura Clan to his shinobi father, Danzō went onto joining the Academy, where he was amongst the first few hundred of students to graduate. From his genin days, he was acquainted with Hiruzen Sarutobi,Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light page 139 whom he became rivals with in everything.Naruto chapter 481, page 8 Danzō once saw the First Hokage in battle, where he witnessed Hashirama's formidable Wood Release.Danzō during the First Shinobi World War.During the First Shinobi World War, Danzō, as part of the Escort Unit alongside Kagami Uchiha, Torifu Akimichi and Team Tobirama, became surrounded by Kumogakure's Kinkaku Squad. Having concluded that a member of their team had to sacrifice themselves as a decoy in order for the rest of them to escape, Danzō struggled to bring himself to volunteer. As Hiruzen proclaimed to take the role, Danzō called himself weak while a part of him was relieved. Lashing out at Hiruzen for volunteering before he could, the Second Hokage decided to be the decoy instead, while appointing Hiruzen as his successor to Danzō's shock. The team then managed to escape at the cost of Tobirama's life.With Hiruzen having beaten him to the title of Hokage, Danzō began planning to someday attain the title himself.Naruto chapter 285, page 17 Taking up the village's more clandestine operations — something that Hiruzen noted because of his own indulgence, he allowed Danzō to doNaruto chapter 627, page 5 — he created the Anbu subsidiary named Root, with the organisation under Danzō's direct command. Within this group, Danzō himself hand-picked various young shinobi with noticeable potential to join.Naruto: Shippūden episode 317Danzō manipulates Hanzō into an alliance against Akatsuki.During the Third Shinobi World War, Danzō agreed to provide aid to Hanzō of Amegakure in order to receive help in claiming the title of Hokage, sending some of his forces to deal with Akatsuki, but they were all wiped out by Nagato.Naruto chapter 446, page 13Naruto chapter 447, pages 6-11 In the anime, it is revealed Danzō had manipulated Hanzō into joining forces with him against Akatsuki, having brought him the corpses of Ame shinobi or members of Hanzō's own clan, claiming they were killed by Akatsuki. In truth, they were Root members who had been disguised as Iwa shinobi, the members in question dying during Nagato's rampage which had him unconsciously summoning the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path after he saw his two friends, Yahiko and Konan being attacked, the group also along with undercover shinobi teams participating in events to disrupt a treaty of peace between Konohagakure and Iwagakure. Taking advantage of the situation, Danzō had the bodies collected as well as any traces of his team's involvement removed before arriving at Hanzō's residence to inform the other man of the development. When Hanzō began expressing doubts, Danzō informed the other man the Akatsuki were wolves disguised as sheep who would usurp his power. Once the two shinobi joined forces, Danzō approached Akatsuki, disguised as an Ame shinobi named , revealing himself to be an adviser to Hanzō, informing them that Hanzō was allowing the group to make peace negotiations, which of course was a ruse concocted by the allied shinobi. He later handed the group a scroll confirming it and saw them celebrating before he departed. The next day, Danzo and his men witnessed the confrontation between Hanzō, Yahiko and Nagato, Hanzō offering to let Konan go if Nagato killed Yahiko but when Nagato refused, Yahiko committed suicide by impaling himself on a kunai Nagato was holding that saw Yahiko dying much to Konan's distress. This prompted Nagato to summon the Demonic Statue which attacked the Root and Amegakure shinobi who had been watching the incident from the cliff, ultimately killing them while Nagato saved Konan but at the cost of his legs being damaged by Hanzō's Fire Release: Exploding Flame Formation. Both Hanzō and Danzō fled, Hanzō using the Body Flicker Technique to escape seconds before Nagato attempted to kill him while Danzō left through unknown means.Danzō enlists Kabuto into Root.At some point in time, Danzō also had dealings with Orochimaru, who accompanied him, along with Tatsuma Aburame, to Konoha Orphanage where he strong-armed a former Anbu agent, Nonō, to infiltrate Iwagakure and confirm the intel on what the village was planning. Soon after, Danzō noticed Kabuto Yakushi spying from the window and decided to recruit the boy as well.Naruto chapter 583, pages 3-8 However, in time, both Kabuto and Nonō became assets too dangerous to be left alive and Danzō tricked a brainwashed Nonō into killing Kabuto. Danzō sent Orochimaru to ensure no survivors, however, he instead took Kabuto under his wing without Danzō's knowledge. At some point, Orochimaru also surgically replaced Danzō's right arm with Shin Uchiha's, infusing the limb with Hashirama Senju's DNA to modify his physical energy.Naruto chapter 478, page 11Naruto chapter 700+7, page 11 Later in the anime, when Hiruzen sought to end the bloodshed from the Third Shinobi World War through a truce with the other villages, Danzō voiced his disdain, feeling that a such an act was spitting on the memory of all the Konoha shinobi who died so far. Understanding Danzō's intent, Hiruzen decided to take responsibility for the loss by stepping down as Hokage. At a meeting with the Land of Fire Council, Danzō strongly suggested that Orochimaru be made Fourth Hokage. Hiruzen, however, pointed out that Orochimaru had grown power-hungry and showed signs of sinister intent. Ultimately, Minato Namikaze was elected as Fourth Hokage unanimously, excluding Danzō who detested the idea, feeling that following Hiruzen's ideology will ultimately destroy Konoha.Naruto: Shippūden episode 349Danzō asks Kakashi to join his forces.In the anime -- during Kurama's attack on Konoha -- Danzō insisted that the Uchiha Clan not be allowed to join in the defence of the village, fearing that someone like Madara Uchiha would take advantage of the situation and use the Nine-Tails against Konoha. Ultimately, he convinced Hiruzen to have the Uchiha purely protect the citizens and avoid the Nine-Tails.Naruto: Shippūden episode 358 After Kurama was stopped, Danzō was one of the elders to suspect the Uchiha clan was behind the attack, and began a spying operation on them, relocating the Uchiha to the outskirts of the village. With the Fourth Hokage sacrificing himself to seal away the Nine-Tails inside his son, Hiruzen humbly resumed his role as Third Hokage, much to Danzō's disdain. Afterwards, Danzō approached a grieving young Kakashi Hatake, noting that it was Hiruzen's orders for the children, even high-ranking ninja like Kakashi, to not help battle the Nine-Tails, ultimately preventing Kakashi from possibly saving his sensei and his wife. Convincing an emotional Kakashi that Hiruzen was not best for the future of the village, Kakashi agreed to join Danzō's Root division and spy on Hiruzen for him.Naruto: Shippūden episode 350 Later, as the Third Hokage resumed his role, Danzō, no longer able to tolerate Hiruzen's overly passive methods, sought to dispose of him. He sent several Root members to assassinate Hiruzen. However, a smug Danzō was soon approached by Hiruzen, who revealed that Kakashi informed him of the assassination attempt. As Danzō feared for his life knowing he could be executed for his treasonous actions, Hiruzen calmly chose to spare Danzō, keeping this event a secret on the condition Danzō agreed to dedicate his life to protecting the village. Quickly recomposing himself, Danzō plainly stated that Hiruzen's naive faith and mercy would be his end one day, to which the Third solemnly admitted may be so. Later, Danzō met with Orochimaru, telling him about the recent events and insisted they not meet for a while in fear Hiruzen might realise that Danzō and Orochimaru were behind the abduction of several Konoha citizens, to which the Sannin voiced that Hiruzen probably already has his suspicions.Naruto: Shippūden episode 351 However, Orochimaru did another implant onto Danzō taking Shin's Sharingan-embedded arm and placing that, alongside some of Hashirama's cells, onto that of Danzō's.Naruto chapter 700+7, pages 12-13Danzō dispatches Kinoe to inform the clan.Later, Orochimaru's sinister actions were discovered by the Third Hokage, forcing the Sannin to abandon Konoha. When Danzō learned of this, he knew Orochimaru would most likely go to their hideout with the Iburi clan. He sent Kinoe to inform the clan of Orochimaru's arrival.Naruto: Shippūden episode 352 Danzō's true goal was to have Kinoe capture Orochimaru, agreeing with Hiruzen that Orochimaru was too dangerous to let go rogue.Naruto: Shippūden episode 353 Over the years, Danzō continued to recruit new members of Root, including Torune Aburame of the Aburame clan. Three years after Orochimaru's defection from the village, fearing that his stolen Sharingan eye would soon go blind from its overuse, Danzō sent Kinoe in an attempt to steal Kakashi's Sharingan as a replacement.Naruto: Shippūden episode 355 Kinoe soon returned, having chosen to abandon his mission, much to Danzō's fury. Reminding the young shinobi of his duties as a Root member, Kinoe insisted that they should not attack allies to Konoha, which Danzō proclaimed that Root's only true allies is its own and exists only to protect Konoha itself. Unable to accept Danzō's cold views, Kinoe spoke out, making his feelings known. Horrified to see how much Kinoe had changed, Danzō used his Sharingan to incapacitate Kinoe, having one of his men take Kinoe to have his cursed seal activated. As Danzō arrived at the operating room, he discovered Kakashi freeing Kinoe and retreating with him. Danzō and his men soon surrounded the duo. As Kinoe was still under Danzō's command and Kakashi had trespassed on Root territory, Danzō had full authority to execute them. Before Danzō could act, the Third Hokage arrived, revealing that Kakashi was sent on his orders with a summoning request to be delivered to Danzō. No longer able to attack, Danzō faked ignorance of Hiruzen's letter and called off his men. Hiruzen then spoke to Danzō about Kinoe and his abilities. Insisting that Konoha needed the Wood Release, Danzō agreed to hand over Kinoe to Hiruzen's command but chose to not remove Kinoe's cursed seal.Naruto: Shippūden episode 356 Three years later, a potential alliance between Konoha and the Land of Woods was made. While a team was sent to exchange secret scrolls with the Wood-nin as a sign of trust, a small team of Anbu, under Danzō's command, was sent to observe under the suspicion that the Wood-nin would betray Konoha, in which case, the Anbu were ordered to kill them. Danzō chose Kakashi, still having high respect for his abilities, and the new recruit Danzō recommended into Anbu, Itachi Uchiha, as a two-man team for the mission.Naruto: Shippūden episode 357Two years later, when word reached Konoha's leadership of a planned coup d'état by the Uchiha clan, Danzō took advantage of Itachi's pacifist tendencies and convinced him to provide him and the other elders with information of the clan's actions. When Shisui Uchiha, acknowledged for his unquestionable loyalty to Konohagakure, presented his plan of ceasing the Uchiha's coup by casting Kotoamatsukami on his clansmen to the Council, Hiruzen agreed. Danzō, however, determined to protect the village in his own way and, believing that Shisui may try to manipulate him as well, stole the latter's right eye, implanting it into his socket, with Shisui committing suicide sometime later.Naruto chapter 550, page 13 When Hiruzen decided to end the coup diplomatically, Danzō secretly met with Itachi and inveigled him into choosing to slaughter his clan by presenting him with the option of killing them and sparing his younger brother, Sasuke Uchiha or letting them go through with the coup and having them all killed as a result.Naruto chapter 590, pages 8-10 Itachi regretfully chose to kill the Uchiha clan. Hiruzen disbands Danzō's organisation. Soon after the deed was done, Danzō told everyone that Itachi had done this out of his own will, having grown to despise his clan and even sought greater power by stealing Shisui's eyes. While everyone else believed this fabricated story, Hiruzen saw through Danzō's lie, voicing his disgust at Danzō's actions. While trying to justify his actions by claiming it was for the village, Hiruzen retorted that the Uchiha were part of the village and never actually performed any treachery before their demise. No longer able to trust Danzō and his underhanded ways, Hiruzen immediately removed him from the Council and ordered for his Root division to be disbanded.Naruto Shippūden episode 359 Afterwards, Itachi's clone, disguised as a Root member, approached Danzō and threatened to expose Konoha's secrets to the other countries if Danzō ever harmed Sasuke.Naruto chapter 400, page 13 He met with Tobi around this time for reasons unknown.Naruto chapter 474, page 12 Over the years, despite his Root division being officially disbanded, Danzō continued to keep it secretly active.During the Konoha Crush, the Fourth Raikage insinuated that the invasion was a secret plot of Danzō with Akatsuki to dispose of both the Hiruzen and the Fourth Kazekage; however, it is unknown whether this actually happened. After seeing Hiruzen sacrifice himself using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal to defeat Orochimaru, Danzō decided to teach Sai how to use a powerful fūinjutsu, in order to prevent the same from happening to himself. During the training, Danzō noted that Sai could use \"emotional energy\" to bolster the power of the attack but warned the young man not to fall prey to his negative emotions.Naruto: Shippūden episode 284 Personality When he was younger, Danzō was a hotheaded and eager ninja with a strong desire to prove himself. He, after a long internal struggle, decided to volunteer himself to buy time for his teammates, though Hiruzen beat him to it.Naruto chapter 481, page 7 He often displayed jealousy towards Hiruzen, believing he was always one step ahead of him and feeling inferior to him. Danzō never used soft words like \"friend\", as he never wanted to lean on someone or be leaned on. As an adult, Danzō was a completely calm, cold and collected individual who did not allow his emotions to surface. Having fought many wars, and having looked up to his father's and grandfather's example of dying in battle, he came to disagree with other Hokage, believing that the interests of the village should be placed above all else, even ethics and morals. Danzō seemed to hate the previous Hokage's beliefs stating those beliefs have destroyed the village after Pain's assault on it, despite using the attack as an attempt to overthrow Tsunade and leaving its citizens in peril as well as being responsible for Nagato's negative perceptions of Konoha, which lead to its destruction. According to Koharu Utatane, Danzō was very ambitious, but she also stated that all he ever did was for the sake of the village. In the anime, his desire to be a greater and stronger Hokage than Hiruzen made him even attempt to have Hiruzen assassinated in the belief that the Third Hokage had lost the capacity to effectively lead the village. An extremist, Danzō preferred to directly eliminate threats through assassination and execution rather than diplomacy and negotiation. However, he secretly worked closely with the international criminal Orochimaru in illegal experiments in order to increase his physical capabilities. Danzō possessed a fanatical and arbitrary adherence to the ideals of a shinobi, believing they must sacrifice absolutely everything for the village. However, Danzō hypocritically feared death, hiding this fear behind a belief that his survival was necessary for the sake of the shinobi world itself. He would only conquer this fear in the last moments of his life, boldly attempting to kill Sasuke and Tobi for the sake of his village and the entire shinobi world with his suicide, and destroying Shisui's eye with his dying breath.After years in Hiruzen's shadow, Danzō begins to actualize his goal of becoming Hokage.Despite his reputation as a militarist, Danzō ultimately sought peace for the ninja world, one he would achieve by uniting all shinobi forces under his control. As such, he sought the title of Hokage, waiting patiently for decades before an opportunity arose. Danzō's pursuit of peace followed an ends justifies the means. As such, he had no remorse taking any immoral actions as long as he believed it would benefit Konoha. To that end, he worked in the shadows to ensure that this future came to fruition. He used Root to eliminate potential threats to Konohagakure with or without the consent of the Hokage and to further him along the path to achieving the position, as he believed he was best prepared for the \"necessary\" transition. Because of the nature of his actions, Danzō could not allow the details of what he had done to become public knowledge, and thus he branded members of Root with cursed seals to prevent them from revealing his secrets.Naruto chapter 452, page 8 Danzō also believed Konoha was strongest and most stable when the village had a target to focus its anger and hatred on. To this end, Danzō was key in stigmatising the Uchiha clan to the rest of the village and was the one to secretly leak out the knowledge that Naruto Uzumaki was the container of the Nine-Tailed Fox, ensuring the villagers would loathe him as a result.Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night Danzō also views the members of Root as expendable pawns and shows no remorse in having them perform duties that could result in permanent injury as shown in his ordering Fū to gouge out Ao's Byakugan, despite the fact it would result in Fū losing his eye as well.Danzō is also treacherous by nature. Likewise, should an \"ally\" prove too capable for his comfort, Danzō will see to their elimination, as he attempted to do with both Nonō and Kabuto. Itachi also believed Danzō had no intention of honouring his promise of sparing Sasuke when he accepted the mission to kill his own clan and had to threaten to leak Konoha's secrets to enemy villages and risk his own safety by returning to Konoha after Hiruzen's death to protect Sasuke's life. He was willing to do anything to further his physical and political powers, as shown in allowing himself to be experimented on with Hashirama's cells by Orochimaru in order to gain the power to control a tailed beast and extend his use of Izanagi. He also broke international law by manipulating Mifune into making him supreme commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces. In his later years, Danzō had become somewhat delusional, believing that he would be able to change the Shinobi World, even though his actions at the Kage Summit lost him his credibility. Danzō also had no hesitation in stealing Shisui's right eye in order to gain access to Kotoamatsukami despite his unquestionable loyalty to Konoha over his own clan and the fact he was a descendant of someone who had once been Danzō's own comrade. Tobi deduced Danzō's intent was to seize control of the Nine-Tails from Naruto by using his multiple Sharingan. Danzō is also shown to be extremely arrogant, as seen in his gloating during his final clash with Sasuke, believing he had won, and only he is capable of changing the entire world.Despite his self-righteous, amoral, and draconian methods, Danzō had a sense of nobility and dignity. He reprimanded Sasuke for his hatred and violence against Konoha, saying that it had wasted both the sacrifice of the Uchiha and Itachi's own personal sacrifices.Naruto chapter 477, page 11 Like Hiruzen, he used the final moments of his life to help Konoha by trying to take Sasuke and Tobi with him. Despite his envy against the Third and their growing rivalry, he seemed to still care for his boyhood friendship with Hiruzen, reminiscing of his childhood memories with him and asking what he was to Hiruzen in his final moments.Naruto chapter 481, page 12 His fellow elders, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, held Danzō in high regard, and often took his advice when dealing with the politics of the village. It is unknown how much they knew about the full extent of his actions. Appearance Danzō's full appearance.Danzō appeared as a frail, old man, who would normally walk with a cane. He had black, shaggy hair, and his right eye was bandaged — concealing a Sharingan underneath. Danzō has had an x-shaped scar on his chin ever since his youth. He wore a white shirt, with a black or dark grey robe over the top of it covering from his feet, to just over his right shoulder. The robe conceals his right arm which was bandaged, and covered with three large golden braces. The bandages hid an arm implanted with ten more Sharingan, originally belonging to Shin Uchiha, and the image of the First Hokage's face protruding from his right shoulder where Hashirama's cells were injected into his body.In his youth Danzō was quite handsome. He had the same shaggy hairstyle, except it was much longer, reaching eye level. He also wore the standard armour of that era, which covered his back, chest areas and lower abdomen while leaving his shoulders armourless. With this he wore a black outfit with matching wrist guards, a shuriken holster on his right upper leg, a pouch tied to his waist with bandages, and a Konoha forehead protector. At that time, he still has both of his normal brown eyes. He hid the right eye with bandages by the time he united with Hanzō in their attack against Akatsuki led by Yahiko, and wore a flak jacket. It was also shown that at least around the time of the Third Shinobi World War, he wore a black, hooded trench coat and high-length sandals. As a child, Danzō's attire consisted of a short dark-green kimono tied with a sash.Naruto: Shippūden episode 211 During his meeting with Akatsuki, having adopted the name, \"Kanzō\", Danzō had long shaggy brown hair, an eyepatch over his right eye with a gas mask hanging around his neck as well as an Amegakure forehead protector. He also wore a dark coat with a shirt visible underneath as well as gloves around both his hands, a pouch on his right leg with bandages visible around both his legs and sandals. Abilities Danzō with the capability to control a tailed beast.As the leader of the Root and the Sixth Hokage Candidate, Danzō was an exceptionally powerful shinobi. Danzō's skills were held in high regard by the elders Homura and Koharu as they considered him one of Konoha's strongest ninja.Naruto chapter 488, page 14 Through skill and trickery, Danzō managed to combat the famed Shisui Uchiha and catch him off guard to steal his right eye. Kakashi expressed intense shock learning Danzō had been defeated single-handedly by Sasuke Uchiha. However, this defeat was partly attributed to his old age, and being unable to use Shisui Uchiha's Mangekyō Sharingan. Despite all this, even with Sasuke's excessive usage of his own Mangekyō Sharingan, Danzō still fought evenly with Sasuke throughout their battle, and dealt him a potentially fatal wound.Danzō was adept in both using and dispelling high-level genjutsu, even from powerful Sharingan-users like Sasuke. He also had some skill in taijutsu and a decent amount of physical strength, able to repel Karin with one kick.Naruto chapter 478, page 4 Danzō was also quite fast and agile as he was able to catch Sasuke off-guard and, in the anime, evade a large amount of debris falling on him. Additionally, Danzō was highly skilled in kenjutsu, as seen against the Prajñā Group. Ninjutsu Danzō's summon, Baku.Danzō was well-versed in fūinjutsu and cursed seals. To prevent his secrets from being exposed, Danzō placed binding seals on the tongues of each Root member. Should a Root member speak openly of Root and Danzō's activities, the seal would instantly paralyse the member's body. Danzō could also implement binding seals in battle, temporarily paralysing the foe. Danzō most powerful seal was the Reverse Four Symbols Sealing. It caused four seal symbols to exit from his chest and form a large sphere around him. Everything inside the sphere was then drawn in and imprisoned within his corpse. Danzō could summon a giant tapir-like creature known as a Baku, described as the \"Nightmare-Eater\". A creature of massive size, it had the ability to suck in objects and targets within the area in front of it. The Baku's suction could also be used to increase the power of Danzō's Wind Release techniques. However, using the suction left the creature vulnerable against fire techniques. Nature Transformation Danzō adding wind-natured chakra onto his kunai.Danzō could utilise Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire Release in nature transformation, as well as Yin and Yang Release. He was particularly proficient in Wind Release, exhaling powerful vacuum-based attacks able to slash like blades or pierce like bullets. He could also use larger or localised variations, strong enough to destroy an extremely durable wooden dome or damage a humanoid Susanoo's defences.Naruto chapter 479. pages 8-9 Danzō's Wind Release could also help him manoeuvre in mid-air, as well as enhance the offensive power of his weapons.Danzō's use of Wood Release.Possessing the First Hokage's cells in his right arm granted Danzō the Wood Release, albeit with a significant toll on his chakra. This combined with his overall rudimentary control and skill with it prompted him to only use it when necessary. It also appeared that he could only use the Wood Release from his modified right arm although he could do so without using hand seals. After suffering a fatal wound from Sasuke, Danzō lost control of Hashirama's cells, prompting him to sever his arm as it began to rapidly grow into a large tree that threatened to engulf him completely. Body Modifications Hashirama's cells (forming a face) alongside the Sharingan on his transplanted arm.Danzō's right arm originally belonged to Shin Uchiha. It was implanted with ten Sharingan and enhanced with Hashirama Senju's cells. Ao also noted that the colour of the chakra in his right arm was also that of Shisui's.Naruto chapter 459, page 14 He normally kept the arm hidden under bandages and a gauntlet-like seal, presumably to conserve chakra and keep the eyes and DNA in check. Due to integration of Hashirama's cells, Danzō also gained the shinobi's ability to heal nearly any wound without the use of hand seals.Fourth Databook According to Tobi, Danzō's possession of both Uchiha and Senju DNA also mean he possessed the potential capability to control Kurama.Naruto chapter 478, page 16 Dōjutsu  Sharingan Danzō's imbedded Sharingan.Danzō's right eye was that of Shisui Uchiha's Sharingan, though, in the anime, Shisui's was not the first one Danzō possessed. He was very skilled at using it, able to detect multiple assassins hidden among his surroundingsNaruto chapter 456, page 3 and subdue individuals with genjutsu. Danzō could use Izanagi, a technique forbidden even amongst the Uchiha clan. While activated, Danzō's own body became a physical illusion, nullifying any injury he received from an opponent. This allowed him to survive otherwise fatal attacks while retaining the ability to inflict physical harm to his opponent. Izanagi gave him another benefit; after being \"killed\", Danzō would appear elsewhere away from danger to catch his foes off guard.Thanks to Hashirama's cells, Izanagi usage was extended for up to 60 seconds in a single Sharingan. While he could not see through or use the passive abilities of the Sharingan embedded in his arm, each eye extended his use of Izanagi, giving him up to 10 minutes of usage. As each had a set amount of time to maintain the technique, he would break its usage in between as he chooses to conserve time for later use.Naruto chapter 479, page 5 Obito explained that this length of time is due to the former's lack of mastery over Hashirama's cells.Naruto chapter 510, page 12 Also, even with Danzō's physical energy augmented by Hashirama's cells, it still took a substantial amount of chakra to sustain the technique. Mangekyō Sharingan Through Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, Danzō could use Kotoamatsukami, able to manipulate other people's thoughts without them being aware of it and make them act as if it was their natural choice. Because Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan circumvents the need to make eye-contact to activate its techniques,Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night, chapter 4 Danzō could make use of it without exposing it.Naruto chapter 459, pages 14-15 Normally, Kotoamatsukami is not a technique that can be used more than once a day. However, augmented by Hashirama's cells, Danzō could use it again after a few hours.Naruto chapter 480, page 11 He had expressed hope in increasing his ability to use this technique more frequently from Orochimaru's data.Naruto chapter 454, page 17 Upon his death, Danzō destroyed the eye in fear that it could one day be used against Konoha. Part II  Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission Danzō assigned Sai to Team Kakashi as part of a plan to secretly assassinate Sasuke Uchiha. To achieve that goal, Danzō had Sai make contact with Orochimaru in a ruse to make it seem he wanted to join forces with him to destroy Konoha. When Sai failed his mission but asked to remain with Team Kakashi, Danzō allowed him to do so while reminding the young man that emotions brought hatred, which in turn led to war. Twelve Guardian Ninja In the anime, Danzō was shown being followed by Anbu agents, on Tsunade's orders, when he was to be briefed by Tatsuji — a spy of his in Amegakure. He and Tatsuji were apprehended by the Anbu and later questioned by Tsunade, although the interrogation was interrupted by Sora, who was discovered eavesdropping. Pain's Assault Danzō ordering Root not to aid Konoha during the invasion.When Pain began his assault on Konoha, Tsunade asked the toad Kōsuke to retrieve Naruto Uzumaki from Mount Myōboku to help defend the village. In the anime, Danzō went to Homura and Koharu to tell them that Tsunade was risking the possible loss of the Fourth Hokage's legacy and the Nine-Tails by calling Naruto back. In the manga however, Danzō waited until everyone had left the room and killed Kōsuke in an attempt to stop Naruto from returning, Danzō then gathered his Root Anbu and instructed them not to aid Konoha in the hopes that Pain's actions would end Tsunade's reign as Hokage. When asked if all the villagers would not then die, Danzō denied this, claiming that Tsunade's medical abilities would save most of them.The Fire Daimyō and the Konoha delegation meet.Following the invasion, leaders of the Land of Fire and Konoha gathered for an emergency meeting. Here, despite Shikaku Nara's best efforts, Danzō convinced the daimyō that previous Hokage's peaceful ideologies had made Konoha weak and presented himself as the type of leader the village currently needed to enforce the laws of shinobi and bring order to the world. After brief consideration, the daimyō agreed to appoint him as Sixth Hokage Candidate. Five Kage Summit Danzō heading towards the Kage Summit.When Danzō returned from the meeting he received a letter from the Fourth Raikage, informing him of the approaching Kage Summit and the actions of Sasuke Uchiha. As his first order, Danzō ordered Sasuke's execution for treason marking him as a missing-nin. Although he would have preferred confining Naruto to protect the Nine-Tails, Danzō was aware of Naruto's new-found popularity in the village following his defeat of Pain and settled to have Naruto watched by his agents at all times to ensure he could be made an official Hokage. He also delayed Anko Mitarashi's assassination while ordering his men to find Kabuto Yakushi instead, who was in possession of medical information that could help with his right eye and arm. Danzō later departed for the Kage Summit with Torune Aburame and Fū Yamanaka as his bodyguards, revealing the Sharingan in his right eye socket when they were ambushed by remnant shinobi of the Land of Woods along the way.The five Kage meeting.Upon arrival in the Land of Iron and the meeting's start, Danzō did not actively participate other than reporting to the other Kage of \"Madara Uchiha\" was involved with Akatsuki. Mifune suggested that the five Kage form an alliance of their villages to eliminate Akatsuki with Danzō as its leader. As the Fourth Raikage accuses him and Akatsuki, rather than Orochimaru, of staging the Konoha Crush to dispose of Hiruzen and the Fourth Kazekage, Ao exposes Danzō's manipulating Mifune before White Zetsu appeared and revealed that Sasuke was nearby. As the Raikage left to eliminate Sasuke, with Ao instructed to keep an eye on Danzō, who explained to the remaining Kage that his ultimate goal was to unify the shinobi nations under one empire, ending the possibility of future war between them.When Sasuke arrived at their location, Danzō and his bodyguards used the opportunity to flee, with Ao in close pursuit. At some point during their escape, Danzō's party was beset by Black Zetsu's Spore Technique, but managed to dispatch the clones. Danzō ordered Fū to stop Ao, and emphasised that the retrieval of his Byakugan was a top priority. Fū managed to throw Ao off their trail, but failed to retrieve the Byakugan.Danzō fighting Sasuke.On their way back to Konoha, Danzō and his men were confronted by Tobi at the Samurai Bridge. Danzō instructed Fū and Torune to distract Tobi while he unsealed his right arm. Once Fū and Torune were defeated, Tobi brought out Sasuke. Danzō then revealed his right arm to show that it was embedded with Sharingan all over, and voiced his intent to add Tobi's and Sasuke's to his collection. Sasuke immediately questioned him about the Uchiha clan's assassination, hoping to find out if the Konoha elders really did force Itachi to murder his family. Danzō confirmed the story and questioned why Itachi would sacrifice peace to tell Sasuke the truth. Angry that Danzō spoke about his brother so casually, Sasuke crushed him with his Susanoo's hand.Sasuke and Danzō strike simultaneously.Despite his apparent death, Danzō was unharmed by Susanoo, as well as Sasuke's subsequent attacks. All the while Danzō goaded Sasuke by constantly talking about Itachi, prompting him to fully develop his Susanoo. Sasuke used Susanoo to fire an arrow at Danzō, who was forced to use his Wood Release to divert the attack. Tobi, having been observing the battle, surmised that his use of Sharingan and Wood Release must mean that he planned to control the Nine-Tails as well, and that he was using Izanagi, with the many Sharingan on his arm being sacrificed one-by-one to escape death. When he was finally reduced to one, Danzō and Sasuke each prepared one final attack; breathing wind-natured chakra onto a kunai creating a blade, Danzō prepared to clash with Sasuke's Chidori Sharp Spear.Sasuke stabs Karin and Danzō.Danzō believed that he had won and told Sasuke to go and join Itachi, before realising that Sasuke's genjutsu tricked him into thinking he has one more eye left to evade the impalement. His depleted chakra levels, coupled with his new injury, caused him to lose control of his wood abilities and he was forced to sever his arm before he was turned into a giant tree. Refusing to accept defeat, Danzō takes Karin as a hostage and prepared to use Shisui's eye before Sasuke extended his Chidori Sharp Spear through Karin to impale Danzo through the heart.Danzō's final attempt to eliminate Sasuke and Tobi.Dying, Danzō staggered towards Sasuke and Tobi, thinking about Hiruzen and lamenting how, no matter what he did, he could never match him, not even having officially becoming Hokage. With his last breath, he proclaimed that for the sake of the world and the safety of Konoha, he would take Sasuke and Tobi with him to the grave. He then activated the Reverse Four Symbols Sealing, but Sasuke and Tobi were able to get out of range. Danzō was, nevertheless, able to destroy Shisui's Sharingan in order to prevent Tobi from obtaining it. Legacy After Danzō's demise, Kakashi and Tsunade worked to tie up all loose ends, researching remaining Root facilities and members. However, not wanting the ex-Root members to become ostracised because of their history with him, the two Hokage chose not to publicly announce their final report. Also, one of Danzō's most loyal followers and top researchers, Tanuki Shigaraki, grew to resent the village for Danzō's death and by extension the disbanding of Root. Wanting revenge, he worked to complete his final project entrusted to him by Danzō, the Gozu Tennō, as a means for his goal.Boruto episode 13 In the anime, Danzō built a room in Root's base that could not be detected by the Byakugan, as a precaution against a possible Hyūga coup. The room was used to conceal Kawaki from Isshiki Ōtsutsuki when he attempted to rebrand him with a Kāma.Boruto episode 215In an ironic turn of events, Sasuke had later unwittingly taken up many of Danzō's traits during the Fourth Shinobi World War after deciding to protect the village, proclaiming that he would change the system of shinobi that he considers the source of all the chaos the ninja world has endured. After the war, though he remains acting mostly in the shadows, he is not as ruthless as Danzō. Video Games  Trivia Elements of Kishimoto's original concept for Itachi bear a resemblance to Danzō. Danzō's family name, Shimura, is written with the kanji for  and  and can be interpreted as \"I did it for the village,\" possibly hinting at Danzō's true intentions. Like Dan Katō, Danzō's name may be a reference to Katō Danzō, a noted ninja master during the time of the Sengoku period of Japan. Elements of Danzō's design and backstory, including the x-shaped scar on his chin and his status as the leader of Root, appear to have been taken from Masashi Kishimoto's original concept for Itachi Uchiha.Jin no Sho, page 380 Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Danzō show that he was 146cm around the time the Valley of the End was created, and 168cm when Tobirama died. In the Jin no Sho, summoning is not listed among Danzō's special characteristics. Also, despite his usage of Izanagi, Yang Release isn't listed as one of his natures. According to the databook(s): Danzō's hobbies were appreciating famous pictures, and keeping diaries. Danzō's favourite food and drink was hijiki (which he shared with his rival Hiruzen Sarutobi) and genmaicha (brown rice tea), while his least favourite was warabimochi (jelly-like confection). Danzō did not want to fight anyone in particular. Danzō's favourite word was . Quotes  (To Hiruzen) \"My father and grandfather died in battle as ninja. Self-sacrifice is a ninja's duty.\" (To Kinoe) \"The world of the shinobi is filled with a myriad of techniques. You cannot compete with just one power. We must master various techniques and use those powers to unite the shinobi world.\" (To Sai) \"Emotions lead one to hate… and hate leads one to conflict and war…\"Naruto chapter 310, page 12 (Danzō on not being well known in the ninja world) \"The ninja world is an ascetic world. To remain anonymous is a source of pride. But by controlling both the surface and underground, one can truly strengthen the village and nation. I will make certain that this summit is a success and that I am recognised as Hokage. Then the jōnin will have no choice but to accept me as Hokage. My era has finally come.\"Naruto chapter 456, page 8 (To Sasuke) \"Self sacrifice, that's what epitomises a shinobi. Never seeing the light of day, toiling in the shadows. That's the way of a true shinobi and not just Itachi. Countless shinobi have died the same way. This world could not function on ideals and pleasantries. It's thanks to people like him that peace has been maintained.\"Naruto chapter 476, page 19 (To Sasuke) \"Two brothers, whose abilities are identical. How could what your eyes perceive be so different. The truth about Itachi isn't important to you at all. Instead you simply want to destroy everything with your hatred. All you're doing is making the sacrifice of the Uchiha clan meaningless.\" (To Sasuke) \"It's not my life I'm worried about. This is for Konoha… for the ninja world… I can't die now… I'll… do anything… to survive. I… am the only one… who can change this world… this girl will be sacrificed for that.\"Naruto chapter 480, page 13 (Last words) \"Hiruzen… it looks like it's my turn next… but I… never did become Hokage… no matter how far I went I could never catch up with you… you are the leaves bathing in the sun. I… am the roots that grow in the dark. Hey, Hiruzen… what do you think of me? What am I to you…?\" \n",

      "is one of the last generation of Kirigakure's Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.Zai no Sho, page 33 He serves as the retainer of the Fifth Mizukage, before later becoming the  himself. Background In the anime, shortly after the Fourth Mizukage's passing and Mei Terumī was made the Fifth, Chōjūrō was present when the village received an invitation from Konohagakure and Sunagakure to join an impromptu Chūnin Exams they would be hosting together. Ao noted that the village was still recovering from the Fourth's passing, so it was decided the Kiri-nin would not take part in this event.Naruto: Shippūden episode 394 Personality Chōjūrō's new-found determination.Despite his membership in the elite Seven Swordsmen group, Chōjūrō is a shy individual and seems to lack confidence in his abilities. He also greatly respects and admires the Fifth Mizukage, as he commented inwardly on wanting to protect her \"beautiful smile\". By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Mei has noted that he has become a lot more confident in himself as seen when he cut down Black Zetsu without reservation and then declares to the Fifth that as a member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, he would guard the area with his life.Naruto chapter 562, page 10-12Years later after becoming the Sixth Mizukage, Chōjūrō has seemed to grow well into his new role, appearing much calmer and confident in his abilities. As a leader, he is patient and methodical, carefully observing the situation and considering the best way to approach it. At the same time, in the anime, is shown to still be with some doubts. Wanting so strongly to bring about a peaceful and happy era for his village, he struggles on how to deal with citizens who openly prefer the old traditions.Boruto episode 29 Despite his continued doubts, he remains selfless, willing to take on any personal harm to seek success.Boruto episode 30 Even when grieving over the loss of a dear ally, he remains composed enough to value the lives of his other allies and hoping to settle things peacefully,Boruto episode 251 while also remaining pragmatic to prepare for a likely conflict.Boruto episode 252 Appearance Chōjūrō in Part II.Chōjūrō has short, tufty blue hair, and dark eyes. He also has pointed, shark-like teeth; a common trait of the members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist as well as apprentices share. He wears square, black-rimmed glasses connected to ear protectors, a blue pin-striped shirt and camouflage pattern pants.He wears his forehead protector on the front of his holster which he uses to carry Hiramekarei. The sword itself is wrapped in bandages leaving only the double hilt visible. He also has shuriken holsters strapped onto each of his legs. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he still wears the same outfit but changed his forehead protector to that of the Alliance's. Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Chōjūrō grew noticeably taller and developed a firmer jawline with some chin stubble. He started wearing glasses with thicker frames and the ear-protectors he wore changed design. He retained his overall attire, but the straps of his sword-holster now only covers his left shoulder. Chōjūrō now also wears his light-grey pants without the dual shuriken holsters. Abilities Despite his meek demeanour, Chōjūrō is a highly capable ninja, earning acceptance into the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, and being chosen as one of the Fifth Mizukage's bodyguards during the Kage Summit. Due to being part of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, Chōjūrō's skills were already considered some of the strongest in the entire village, showing he had great potential. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he proved able to defeat Black Zetsu while fighting alongside his allies. Years later, Chōjūrō's abilities improved immensely as he was promoted to the rank of Sixth Mizukage. Even against multiple wielders of the Seven Mist Swords, Chōjūrō is able to systematically defeat his foes. While working alongside the Fifth Kazekage or Fourth Tsuchikage, he was able to hold his own even against enemies as strong as the Ōtsutsuki Clan.Boruto episode 62Boruto episode 64 Kenjutsu & Physical Prowess Chōjūrō wielding Hiramekarei. Chōjūrō is referred as a master swordsman, even amongst the other Seven Mist Swordsmen.Naruto Shippūden episode 266 Amongst the Five Kage, he is rumoured to be the best swordsman and assassin.Boruto: Naruto the Movie novelAs a kenjutsu practitioner, Chōjūrō wields a dual-handled sword called Hiramekarei, that is linked together at the handles by a chain. When released from its bandages, it releases the chakra stored in it and shape weapons, such as an enormous hammer, capable of sending Sasuke flying through a wall despite being shielded by Susanoo, as well as a massive longsword, capable of taking out several targets simultaneously.Naruto chapter 466, page 4 As Mizukage, he could fire a detached long-ranged chakra blade with a swing of Hiramekarei, create a copy of it with chakra for dual wielding, as well as create several knives strong enough to immobilise opponents.Boruto: Naruto the MovieAs Mizukage, his skills in kenjutsu allowed him to fight on par with Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, and is regarded as having no equal while wielding Hiramekarei.Boruto episode 24 In the anime, even without Hiramekarei, Chōjūrō remained a fierce battler, armed only with a standard katana. Against the self-proclaimed New Seven Ninja Swordsmen, wielding three of the signature weapons, Chōjūrō proved very resilient, easily taking multiple puncture wounds and breaking free from his wire-bindings. Once on the offence, he seamlessly overpowered the foes with mightier weapons using only a broken sword. He also showed considerable strength, able to easily hold up Kubikiribōchō with a single hand. Ninjutsu  Nature Transformation Chōjūrō utilising Water Release.In the anime, Chōjūrō is highly skilled in Water Release, able to perform them with few-to-no hand signs and little need of already-existing water. If he's without an actual sword, he can create a blade of water to work as a replacement, as well as produce a massive water surge from underground to catch an opponent off guard and subdue them. He can also produce a barrage of water bullets to assault his enemies.Boruto episode 246 Part II  Five Kage Summit The Kage's bodyguards on the offensive.Chōjūrō and Ao were chosen to escort the Fifth Mizukage to the Kage Summit. During their trip to the Land of Iron, Chōjūrō was frequently embarrassed by the Mizukage's concern over him, which earned him scolding from Ao. Once they finally arrived and the meeting began, Ao and Chōjūrō rushed to her defence during the Fourth Raikage's outburstNaruto chapter 458, pages 4-5 and later White Zetsu's appearance at the Summit.Naruto chapter 459, pages 16-17 Chōjūrō attacks Sasuke.When Sasuke Uchiha infiltrated the conference hall, Chōjūrō activated Hiramekarei and formed it into a hammer which he used to knock Sasuke into a sealed off, adjacent hall where the Mizukage could fight him alone. Although Sasuke was able to escape, his actions convinced the Kage to begin working together. When Tobi appeared and told the attendees of his Eye of the Moon Plan, Chōjūrō silently listened on and later after the masked man had left, as a sign of good faith, Chōjūrō told those in attendance about Kisame Hoshigaki and his Samehada but was cut off by Ōnoki who stated that they were already aware of this information.Naruto chapter 468, pages 8-9After leaving the Summit with Mei, they followed Ao, who was tracking Danzō and his delegation. When they finally caught up with Ao, the Mizukage was able to stop Ao from seemingly beheading himself. She realised that he was under enemy control, and requested to use Hiramekarei to force him out. Fū insulted her upon learning that she knew he wasn't really Ao, and she quickly punched Ao before realising that the opponent had already released the technique. Later, when they return to Kirigakure they are informed that the daimyō had approved the formation of the Shinobi Alliance. Paradise Life on a Boat In the anime, Chōjūrō was sent by the Mizukage in a diplomatic mission to better Kirigakure's relationship with Iwagakure, along with Kurotsuchi and Akatsuchi who were also sent by the Third Tsuchikage on the same mission to stop Ganryū in the process. Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation Chōjūrō attended the last meeting that was held by the Alliance in order to fully prepare for the upcoming war. The Mizukage told him to contact Ao in the Sensor Division and tell him that they needed to hurry. Chōjūrō later joined Mei in guarding the various daimyō during war. When Black Zetsu located the daimyō, he, Genma Shiranui, and Raidō Namiashi, as well as the other members, confronted the Akatsuki member.Chōjūrō cuts down Black Zetsu.As the battle between the two sides waged on throughout the night, one of Naruto Uzumaki's shadow clones arrived to help in the battle. During the fight one Black Zetsu's branches caught Naruto's foot, causing his Rasenshuriken attack to miss. Chōjūrō used that opportunity to attack from behind with his Hiramekarei. Forming it into a longsword, he cuts through Black Zetsu, and stated that the more confident he was, the stronger his strike. He then pinned Black Zetsu to the ground with the tip of his sword and told Mei — who was being called away — to deal with the reincarnated Madara Uchiha and that as one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist he would defend that point with his life. Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes Naruto and Sasuke eventually release the Infinite Tsukuyomi, freeing Chōjūrō and the rest of the world and thus ending the Fourth Shinobi World War. Blank Period  Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness Chōjūrō participating in the Shinobi Union.With the Allied Shinobi Forces disbanding in the aftermath of the Fourth Shinobi World War, the Shinobi Union is formed, with Chōjurō representing his village. During one such meeting, Chōjurō gave a report about the missing shinobi after the war. The Last: Naruto the Movie Two years following the Fourth Shinobi World War, after meteors began frequently hitting the planet, a Kage Summit was convened. Chōjūrō accompanied the Fifth Mizukage to it. Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise Chōjūrō helps the Fifth Mizukage protect Kiri from the exploding humans. New Era Chōjūrō captures Araumi.Chōjūrō eventually succeeds Mei and became the Sixth Mizukage. Upon recently becoming a Kage, he and Misuno attend a Five Kage Summit in Konohagakure. During the meeting Sasuke came forth to reveal evidence of a new White Zetsu Army being formed and a potential threat even greater than Kaguya. Ultimately, it was agreed to keep this information a secret from the public and allow Sasuke to continue his research and further investigate his sources. In the anime, five years prior to Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's defeat, Chōjūrō led a mission to capture Araumi Funato, leading to the pirate's clan falling into disarray and allowing trades on the sea to resume safely. During another summit held in Konoha, Chōjūrō comments on how the Hokage is late for a summit held in his own village. School Trip Arc Chōjūrō welcomes Konoha's Academy students to Kirigakure.In the anime, to improve relationships with other villages and symbolically show the warring era was over, Naruto set up an official class trip for the Academy to go to Kirigakure. He worked out the details with Chōjūrō, who assigned Kagura Karatachi as a tour guide for the class. The next day, as Kagura continued to grow closer to the Konoha-nin, an improve in outlook made Kagura request the Sixth Mizukage to take the test to claim Hiramekarei. Later, Chōjūrō and Mei learned that Kagura had joined Shizuma Hoshigaki's team and helped them steal all the Seven Mist Swordsmen's blades. While the Sixth Mizukage was strongly considering killing them all for the treachery, Boruto insisted that Kagura was not truly a traitor, but being manipulated. Boruto also insisted to treat this as a children's fight so as to not make a public scene. Chōjūrō agreed to this on the condition that he join them in ending the revolt and if it was completed before curfew. Chōjūrō facing Kyohō.They found the rebellious group at the Kiri Memorial where Shizuma's team was about to destroy it, seeing it as an insult to Kirigakure's pride. As the fight began, Chōjūrō was subdued by the Nuibari. The group voiced their disdain at Chōjūrō, feeling that his efforts for peace were a disgrace to their heritage as ninja and that Chōjūrō was trying to erase the very memory of the fiercest ninja in Kirigakure's history. Chōjūrō did concede to some of their words, voicing his true regret at now being able to make everyone pleased with this modernisation. The group rejected his apology and attacked him with three of the Mist Blades. Chōjūrō anticipated their attack patterns and used it to break free. While his foes scoffed at Chōjūrō facing them with only a standard katana, Chōjūrō retorted that a weapon is only as powerful as its wielders. Proving his point, he continued to exploit the revolutionaries' key weakness and defeated them. After restraining all them, he went to deal with Shizuma. He arrived to see the rebellious ninja being absorbed by Samehada. He explained to the Konoha-nin that Samehada's ravenous nature makes it so only the most experienced of wielders should attempt usage of it. In his imperfect shark-form, Shizuma went on a feral rampage. While Chōjūrō asked Kagura for Hiramekarei, Kagura wished to fix this mistake personally. Together with Boruto, the two were able to separate Shizuma from Samehada and end the rebellion. Afterwards, Shizuma and his team were sent to prison for rehabilitation. Expanding on Boruto's idea of lessening the severity of the situation, Chōjūrō decided to cover it up in fear of the news spreading leading to the regress of the village to its darker times. He later saw off the Konoha class as they returned home. Chōjūrō then began giving Kagura special training to help him overcome his insecurities at drawing a sword. Realising how full of shame Kagura was for his actions, he insisted to talk to Boruto and apologise with honesty, knowing that the boy would forgive Kagura. Versus Momoshiki Arc Chōjūrō attacks Urashiki.Chōjūrō attended the Chūnin Exams and sat with the other Kage during the third round. During which, the village was attacked by members of the Ōtsutsuki Clan, Momoshiki, Kinshiki, and, in the anime, Urashiki. During which, Chōjūrō aided Gaara in attempted to subdue Urashiki, only for the foe to escape. After the attack ended, Naruto was captured by the foes. Chōjūrō, the other Kage, Sasuke and Boruto decided to rescue him. Chōjūrō and Kurotsuchi restraining Kinshiki.After being transported to the dimension where Naruto was, Sasuke battled Momoshiki while he and the other Kage fight Kinshiki off. During the battle, he restrained Kinshiki from moving after Sasuke destroyed his weapon, allowing Kurotsuchi to capture him. However, he later manages to break free and let himself get absorbed by Momoshiki. Momoshiki then later proceeded to capture Chōjūrō and the other Kage in his shadow jutsu before Boruto threw his Vanishing Rasengan to free them. With Sasuke's help, Boruto managed to defeat Momoshiki with a giant Rasengan. After Momoshiki's defeat, Chōjūrō posed for a photograph with the other Kage, Sasuke and Boruto.In the anime, after Konohagakure recovered from the Ōtsutsuki attack, a Kage Summit was held. Chōjūrō and the other retired Kage were in attendant to discuss the still looming threat of the Ōtsutsuki. Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc In the anime, Chōjūrō attended Ōnoki's funeral. Shikamaru Shinden: A Cloud Dancing in Forlorn Falling Petals Chōjūrō and Misuno attended a Kage Summit in Konoha at the Hokage building, during which the Kage bickered about topics concerning Konoha, leading to Kurotsuchi demanding Konoha to disclose all of its confidential information as the village's proof to peace by the next summit, and said Iwagakure would leave the Five Great Shinobi Country alliance if they didn't. After the demand, the summit ended. Kara Actuation Arc In the anime, Rock Lee was sent to Kiri as a messenger to inform Chōjūrō of the threat of Kara. Kawaki Arc When Team 7 found a mysterious boy with connections to Kara, Naruto called forth a Kage Summit. As talks about the boy's fate began, it was unanimously decided to treat the boy with sympathy as they were no strangers to children being made into weapons (i.e. jinchūriki). It was also agreed for the boy to live with Naruto, who would watch over him at all times, which Kurotsuchi was impressed at how much multi-tasking Naruto could do through his shadow clones. Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc Chōjūrō hands Hiramekarei to Kagura.In the anime, sometime after Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's defeat, Kirigakure hosted a ceremony that invited various scientists and dignitaries from around the world to witness the unveiling of their new power plants that both generated great amounts of electricity, but also controlled the raging nature of the ocean. Security was tight due to rumours of an attack. Chōjūrō spoke on the ceremony, and organised the audience to be flown to visit the Shinonome 1 power station. However, one of the airships carrying industrialists crashed and exploded. Chōjūrō put out the fires in coordination with other Kiri-nin. He ordered the area to be put in lock-down to prevent potential suspects from escaping before they could be investigated. He later learned the attack on the airship was a distraction by the Funato Clan, so they could break out their leader Araumi Funato from prison. Unable to spare the man-power, he allowed Kagura to aid Team 7, recruiting Buntan Kurosuki, Hebiichigo, and Kyohō Fuefuki from prison. He handed Kagura Hiramekarei, and allowed the released swordsmen access to the blades, though they were branded with cursed seals.Later, with the Funato Clan's continued expansion, with many Land of Water citizens joining them, Chōjūrō was forced to leave the village and join the front-lines. Soon, Chōjūrō met the Funato main fleet, and demanded their surrender. He remained concerned even as Misuno reported that the Funato forces remained on the defensive. When he received Kagura's message about the Funato fleet being a diversion, he chose to feign ignorance not to alert them. By nightfall, Tenma Funato attempted to infiltrate their ship with a small team to assassinate him, but Chōjūrō anticipated it, and prepared an ambush of his own. The Kirigakure forces overpowered Tenma's group until only Tenma remained. He offered to spare Tenma if he revealed the Funato's goals, but Tenma attacked, forcing Chōjūrō to cut him down. He had their fleet attack the Funato fleet, prompting their retreat.Chōjūrō is protected by Misuno.Later, Misuno notified him of Kagura's and Hebiichigo's death in action. Kagura's death in particular hit him hard, having wished for Kagura to be Mizukage one day, and firmly declared his desire to wipe out the Funato. He was notified that Isari Funato had reached out, wishing to negotiate. Misuno questioned why he'd be willing to negotiate with the Funato, and Chōjūrō explained that while he has no personal problems eradicating them, prolonging the conflict would only result in more casualties. Isari and Jibiki were brought him, restrained, but Isari broke free of his, wishing to negotiate as an equal. Despite the tension, they agreed to talk, but were interrupted by Araumi's broadcast, announcing an all-out attack. Chōjūrō questioned Isari's presence, though Jibiki vouched for him. When Araumi declared that not even relatives would be spared if they stood against him, the Marlin Harpoon came alive and skewered Isari, before attempting to do the same to Chōjūrō. The harpoon was cut down by Misuno. Upon learning that the Funato intended to attack the Shinonome 1 power station, and were taking the shortest, but dangerous Sea of Death route to get to it, he ordered that all ships that could intercept them set sail.As the Kirigakure forces prepared to defend the Shinonome 1, Team 7 arrived by boat to return Kagura's Hiramekarei to Chōjūrō. They voiced their desire to end the war with no more bloodshed. While sympathising with their desire for peace, Chōjūrō revealed that Araumi was so driven for war and conquest, he even killed Isari when he tried to broker peace. As Chōjūrō insisted that they must protect the Shinonome 1, Boruto noted that the Funato's goal of conquest seemed to originally be sparked from rejection of the Shinonome 1, a construct that many in the Land of Water were openly against. Boruto insisted that he could get through to Ikada Funato, who was their friend before joining the war. Reluctantly, Chōjūrō agreed to give Boruto some time to meet with the Funato. In the event of failure, Chōjūrō began galvanising his forces for war. As Team 7 approached the Funato ships, Chōjūrō and Misuno listened in through their ship's instruments. Misuno wasn't surprised by their hostility and asked Chōjūrō what they should do, him telling her Team 7 still had more time. He was shocked when the Funato mobile fortress appeared, its Chakra Cannon charging a shot at the Shinonome 1. Chōjūrō was even more shocked when Boruto willingly offered his own life in order to stop the war. Though Chōjūrō became concerned for Boruto, he couldn't allow the Funato make their first move and told Misuno to prepare an attack on the Funato mobile fortress. He also commented Boruto's determination became merely naïve and that would not stop the war. However, after Team 7's genuine actions made Ikada save Boruto from drowning, and he and his men abandoned their hatred toward Kirigakure and withdrew, Chōjūrō was ashamed for dismissing Boruto's determination and twisting Kagura's wishes because of his own hatred, admitting he still had much to learn.Chōjūrō and Misuno discuss the aftermath of the Funato war.In the aftermath, Chōjūrō received a report of the damages, as well as a request by the Water Daimyō to deliver harsh punishment to the Funato commanders Araumi and Ikada. He and Misuno discussed the situation and lives that were lost, and he concluded that the too quick modernisation was responsible for much of the Funato support. The development of the Shinonome project was suspended, so they could get support from the entire country. He delivered Ikada's sentence of constant surveillance, placing him under Kajiki's watch. Due to Team 5's and Team 7's involvement in the conflict, he notified Konoha of these developments. Code's Assault Arc Following the defeat of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki, Naruto had a Kage Summit set up via video. The other Kage were caught up on the newest developments. Chōjūrō asked what the goals were of the last remaining Inner, Code. They speculated that Code, as a devout follower of Isshiki, would seek to kill all those responsible for killing Isshiki, and completing the growth of the Ten-Tails. As everyone was concerned to hear about a new Ten-Tails, they asked what Naruto would do with his son if Momoshiki took over Boruto completely through the Kāma. Naruto swore he would handle the matter as it was needed to be done. In Other Media  Video Games Chōjūrō is a support-only character in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, and Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. Creation and Conception Wanting to create a younger character, Masashi Kishimoto gave Chōjūrō short hair and attire that was not that of the standard shinobi. Then wanting to give him an air of unreliability, he immediately gave him glasses. The jagged teeth, Kishimoto admits, was simply an indulgence on his part. Trivia   is a red-coloured cultivar of the \"Asian pear\"; like all members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen, his name is derived from a type of produce. In the anime, it is revealed that Chōjūrō dislikes oily foods.Naruto: Shippūden episode 218 Despite the time of Chōjūrō's inauguration being unknown, he had recently become a Kage at the time of the Five Great Shinobi Countries co-sponsorship Chūnin Exams. Quotes  (About the Fifth Mizukage) \"She's so kind. I will do everything to protect that smile on our gentle Mizukage. I hope I can.\"Naruto chapter 454, page 7 (After cutting down Black Zetsu) \"The more confident you are the stronger the strike. I had to cut him down anyway…\" \n",

      "This is a secret taijutsu of the Hyūga clan's main house, traditionally only known by the head of the clan and the clan's heir. Neji Hyūga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. Using their Byakugan's near-360° field of vision, the Hyūga envisions themselves within the centre of an Eight Trigrams symbol. The user then delivers a series of attacks to a target that is within the symbol's perimeter, striking sixty-four of their tenketsu. Those sixty-four tenketsu are subsequently blocked, stopping the flow of chakra within the target's body and making it difficult for them to move. Alternatively, the sixty-four strikes can be split amongst multiple targets, such as to to deflect incoming projectiles.Naruto chapter 195The sixty-four strikes are broken into six smaller sets. Users perform each set of strikes within the same length of time, but because each set has more strikes than the one before it, the set's strikes become increasingly faster. The last set, during which thirty-two strikes are performed, is especially difficult, demanding great resolve and a strong step forward to pull off.Naruto chapter 633 As targets are struck, they are increasingly knocked backwards, with the combined force of the final sets being great enough to push them through tree trunks.Naruto chapter 194 The six sets of strikes are:Two consecutive strikes.Two more consecutive strikes, totalling four.Four consecutive strikes, totalling eight.Eight consecutive strikes, totalling sixteen.Sixteen consecutive strikes, totalling thirty-two.Thirty-two consecutive strikes, totalling sixty four. Trivia  In the anime, Shira was able to block all sixty-four strikes because of his speed and taijutsu skill.Naruto: Shippūden episode 400 See Also  Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms \n",

      "Sukunahikona is a dōjutsu of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's unspecified right eye. It allows him to instantaneously shrink himself or any nonliving matter within his gaze and return it to its original size at will. Overview Sukunahikona allows the user to shrink themselves and targets within the user sight, even energy and other chakra-based substances, though living beings other than the user cannot be affected. Because the change in size happens too fast for the human eye to see, it is often mistaken for teleportation. It cannot be used on oneself if they are physically paralysed. Daikokuten can be used to store shrunken objects within a dimension where time doesn't flow, allowing them to maintain their condition.Isshiki Ōtsutsuki utilised this jutsu while on the verge of death after being betrayed by Kaguya to enter the body of Jigen, which allowed him to survive as a parasite before taking over his brain.Isshiki employs this technique in combat by shrinking his projectile attacks to keep his enemies from defending against them and then restoring them to their original size to inflict critical damage. He also uses it to dodge enemy attacks and free himself from restraints. He is still able to use Kāma's absorption while shrunk himself. He could also use this defensively against what Kāma cannot absorb, such as reducing natural flames that were burning him. The shrinkage is not limited to an object's entirety, as Isshiki can shrink a section of the target object, such as causing a building to cave in or remove a section of a rooftop.While inhabiting Jigen’s body, this technique normally required hand gestures in order to shrink foreign matter, but in his original form, Isshiki can achieve the effect just by looking at desired objects. Trivia  This technique appears to be inspired by Sukonabikona, the son of a goddess of creation whose name means \"small lord of renown\", a dwarf no bigger than a \n",

      "300pxThe  is a planetary body orbiting Earth. It was created a millennium ago by Hamura and Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the former of which gave it its name.The Last: Naruto the Movie novel History The moon being created.The Moon was created by Hagoromo and his brother, Hamura, when they sealed their mother, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, with Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei. After the Moon's creation, Hamura took leadership of the Ōtsutsuki clan and settled on the Moon in order to guard the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path inside.Fourth Databook, pages 216-217 Hagoromo asked Hamura to monitor mankind, a task that was passed to the rest of the Ōtsutsuki when Hamura died. Over time, a civil war broke out between the main and branch families over ideologies, which drove Hamura's clan to near extinction and his message became misguided: if mankind was deemed unworthy, they were to be destroyed.The Last: Naruto the MovieThe moon reflecting the Infinite Tsukuyomi.Centuries later, sometime prior to the Second Shinobi World War, Madara Uchiha summoned the Demonic Statue from the Moon with his Rinnegan, intent on using it to bring peace to the world.Naruto chapter 606, page 13 In order to achieve this goal, Madara came up with the Eye of the Moon Plan, wherein the Ten-Tails would be revived and its jinchūriki would cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi on the Moon, thereby ending all conflicts by trapping the world in a perpetual dream.Naruto chapter 467 Fulfilment of much of the plan ultimately falls to Obito Uchiha upon Madara's death, though Madara is revived in time to see the plan completed during the Fourth Shinobi World War. The Infinite Tsukuyomi is later broken by the combined efforts of Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha.The Moon, cut in half by Toneri Ōtsutsuki.Two years after the war, the last surviving member of the Ōtsutsuki clan's branch family, Toneri Ōtsutsuki, began moving the Moon toward the Earth so that he could destroy it and rebuild a purer world from the ashes. As the Moon began breaking up in the Earth's gravity and increasingly raining meteors upon its surface, Konohagakure sent a team to rescue Hanabi Hyūga, eventually ending up on the Moon. Toneri was eventually defeated by Naruto and Hamura's actual mission was afterwards explained to him by Hinata Hyūga. Apologetic, Toneri restored the Moon to its previous orbit and, despite an invitation to live on the Earth, stayed on the Moon, vowing that it would never threaten the world again. Environment The exterior of the Moon is barren, covered with craters and canyons. It has a weak gravity, but is still able to maintain a breathable atmosphere inside the Moon. Despite its harsh conditions, the Ōtsutsuki were able to settle on the Moon due to their unique anatomy and physiology. To improve its habitability and allow their population to thrive, the Ōtsutsuki built the Tenseigan at the centre of the Moon, granting them light, powering their equipment, and allowing them to control the Moon's movements. Similar to a Dyson sphere, they created a vast environment on the Moon's interior surface, complete with oceans, mountains, forests, and various animal species, however this environment was far smaller than the full size of the Moon itself. The full size is unknown, but its at least as big as a small country. Several villages were built across the landscape, which were steadily abandoned as the Ōtsutsuki's population dwindled.The artificial sun at the centre of the Moon created by the Tenseigan is actually a barrier, within which are housed various important sites, such as Hamura's shrine, the Tenseigan itself, and a castle where Toneri lives. All are guarded by an army of puppets, controllable without chakra threads because of the Tenseigan, as well as the golem created by Toneri.There is at least one portal that enables travel from the Earth to the Moon and back. Located underground, the portal itself takes the form of a spring of green water, though contact with the water doesn't leave one wet. By entering the portal, one travels through a dimension filled with various orbs, some of which are earthen in composition, others trap those who contact them in their own memories. At the Moon's end of the portal is the Gatekeeper, a giant crab that prevents unauthorised access. This portal collapses shortly after Toneri's defeat. Trivia Gaara's destructiveness and blood-lust was heightened during a full moon. The anime often depicts the Moon as red during significant events. There have been cases that both the tailed beasts and their jinchūriki are affected to a certain degree during a full Moon: According to Gaara, Shukaku's blood-lust is especially strong during a full Moon.Naruto chapter 91, page 19 In the anime, Blue B, during his time as Gyūki's jinchūriki, noted that he would have trouble sleeping during the nights of the full Moon, because anytime he would stare at it, it would reflect the loneliness in his heart. Gyūki would take advantage of those moments of weakness and try to control over Blue B's body. Blue B was also shown to take sleeping pills to help with this side-effect.Naruto: Shippūden episode 318 An early account of the story given in the series, Hagoromo alone is said to have created the Moon at the end of his life, using it to store the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path so that the Ten-Tails could never be reborn.  There are two other known moons that exist in the Naruto universe, both of which are located in Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's dimensions. The first, which is located in the core dimension, was created by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha after they managed to seal Kaguya for a second time. The second moon is located in the icy realm, and the circumstances in how it was created are unknown. In the anime, when Kaguya first cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi, she used a moon from an unidentified location, by opening a portal to another dimension. \n",

As the founder and leader of Root, Danzō gained notoriety as Naruto chapter 459, page 1 because of his frequent unsanctioned actions and his often-suspected (but rarely proven) undermining of specific Konoha personnel. Despite his decades of suspicious deeds, Danzō only ever acted in what he believed were the village\\'s best interests. He was appointed the Kai no Sho page 116 after Pain\\'s Assault, but died before he could be formally approved to the position. Background Born into the Shimura Clan to his shinobi father, Danzō went onto joining the Academy, where he was amongst the first few hundred of students to graduate. From his genin days, he was acquainted with Hiruzen Sarutobi,Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light page 139 whom he became rivals with in everything.Naruto chapter 481, page 8 Danzō once saw the First Hokage in battle, where he witnessed Hashirama\\'s formidable Wood Release.Danzō during the First Shinobi World War.During the First Shinobi World War, Danzō, as part of the Escort Unit alongside Kagami Uchiha, Torifu Akimichi and Team Tobirama, became surrounded by Kumogakure\\'s Kinkaku Squad. Having concluded that a member of their team had to sacrifice themselves as a decoy in order for the rest of them to escape, Danzō struggled to bring himself to volunteer. As Hiruzen proclaimed to take the role, Danzō called himself weak while a part of him was relieved. Lashing out at Hiruzen for volunteering before he could, the Second Hokage decided to be the decoy instead, while appointing Hiruzen as his successor to Danzō\\'s shock. The team then managed to escape at the cost of Tobirama\\'s life.With Hiruzen having beaten him to the title of Hokage, Danzō began planning to someday attain the title himself.Naruto chapter 285, page 17 Taking up the village\\'s more clandestine operations — something that Hiruzen noted because of his own indulgence, he allowed Danzō to doNaruto chapter 627, page 5 — he created the Anbu subsidiary named Root, with the organisation under Danzō\\'s direct command. Within this group, Danzō himself hand-picked various young shinobi with noticeable potential to join.Naruto: Shippūden episode 317Danzō manipulates Hanzō into an alliance against Akatsuki.During the Third Shinobi World War, Danzō agreed to provide aid to Hanzō of Amegakure in order to receive help in claiming the title of Hokage, sending some of his forces to deal with Akatsuki, but they were all wiped out by Nagato.Naruto chapter 446, page 13Naruto chapter 447, pages 6-11 In the anime, it is revealed Danzō had manipulated Hanzō into joining forces with him against Akatsuki, having brought him the corpses of Ame shinobi or members of Hanzō\\'s own clan, claiming they were killed by Akatsuki. In truth, they were Root members who had been disguised as Iwa shinobi, the members in question dying during Nagato\\'s rampage which had him unconsciously summoning the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path after he saw his two friends, Yahiko and Konan being attacked, the group also along with undercover shinobi teams participating in events to disrupt a treaty of peace between Konohagakure and Iwagakure. Taking advantage of the situation, Danzō had the bodies collected as well as any traces of his team\\'s involvement removed before arriving at Hanzō\\'s residence to inform the other man of the development. When Hanzō began expressing doubts, Danzō informed the other man the Akatsuki were wolves disguised as sheep who would usurp his power. Once the two shinobi joined forces, Danzō approached Akatsuki, disguised as an Ame shinobi named , revealing himself to be an adviser to Hanzō, informing them that Hanzō was allowing the group to make peace negotiations, which of course was a ruse concocted by the allied shinobi. He later handed the group a scroll confirming it and saw them celebrating before he departed. The next day, Danzo and his men witnessed the confrontation between Hanzō, Yahiko and Nagato, Hanzō offering to let Konan go if Nagato killed Yahiko but when Nagato refused, Yahiko committed suicide by impaling himself on a kunai Nagato was holding that saw Yahiko dying much to Konan\\'s distress. This prompted Nagato to summon the Demonic Statue which attacked the Root and Amegakure shinobi who had been watching the incident from the cliff, ultimately killing them while Nagato saved Konan but at the cost of his legs being damaged by Hanzō\\'s Fire Release: Exploding Flame Formation. Both Hanzō and Danzō fled, Hanzō using the Body Flicker Technique to escape seconds before Nagato attempted to kill him while Danzō left through unknown means.Danzō enlists Kabuto into Root.At some point in time, Danzō also had dealings with Orochimaru, who accompanied him, along with Tatsuma Aburame, to Konoha Orphanage where he strong-armed a former Anbu agent, Nonō, to infiltrate Iwagakure and confirm the intel on what the village was planning. Soon after, Danzō noticed Kabuto Yakushi spying from the window and decided to recruit the boy as well.Naruto chapter 583, pages 3-8 However, in time, both Kabuto and Nonō became assets too dangerous to be left alive and Danzō tricked a brainwashed Nonō into killing Kabuto. Danzō sent Orochimaru to ensure no survivors, however, he instead took Kabuto under his wing without Danzō\\'s knowledge. At some point, Orochimaru also surgically replaced Danzō\\'s right arm with Shin Uchiha\\'s, infusing the limb with Hashirama Senju\\'s DNA to modify his physical energy.Naruto chapter 478, page 11Naruto chapter 700+7, page 11 Later in the anime, when Hiruzen sought to end the bloodshed from the Third Shinobi World War through a truce with the other villages, Danzō voiced his disdain, feeling that a such an act was spitting on the memory of all the Konoha shinobi who died so far. Understanding Danzō\\'s intent, Hiruzen decided to take responsibility for the loss by stepping down as Hokage. At a meeting with the Land of Fire Council, Danzō strongly suggested that Orochimaru be made Fourth Hokage. Hiruzen, however, pointed out that Orochimaru had grown power-hungry and showed signs of sinister intent. Ultimately, Minato Namikaze was elected as Fourth Hokage unanimously, excluding Danzō who detested the idea, feeling that following Hiruzen\\'s ideology will ultimately destroy Konoha.Naruto: Shippūden episode 349Danzō asks Kakashi to join his forces.In the anime -- during Kurama\\'s attack on Konoha -- Danzō insisted that the Uchiha Clan not be allowed to join in the defence of the village, fearing that someone like Madara Uchiha would take advantage of the situation and use the Nine-Tails against Konoha. Ultimately, he convinced Hiruzen to have the Uchiha purely protect the citizens and avoid the Nine-Tails.Naruto: Shippūden episode 358 After Kurama was stopped, Danzō was one of the elders to suspect the Uchiha clan was behind the attack, and began a spying operation on them, relocating the Uchiha to the outskirts of the village. With the Fourth Hokage sacrificing himself to seal away the Nine-Tails inside his son, Hiruzen humbly resumed his role as Third Hokage, much to Danzō\\'s disdain. Afterwards, Danzō approached a grieving young Kakashi Hatake, noting that it was Hiruzen\\'s orders for the children, even high-ranking ninja like Kakashi, to not help battle the Nine-Tails, ultimately preventing Kakashi from possibly saving his sensei and his wife. Convincing an emotional Kakashi that Hiruzen was not best for the future of the village, Kakashi agreed to join Danzō\\'s Root division and spy on Hiruzen for him.Naruto: Shippūden episode 350 Later, as the Third Hokage resumed his role, Danzō, no longer able to tolerate Hiruzen\\'s overly passive methods, sought to dispose of him. He sent several Root members to assassinate Hiruzen. However, a smug Danzō was soon approached by Hiruzen, who revealed that Kakashi informed him of the assassination attempt. As Danzō feared for his life knowing he could be executed for his treasonous actions, Hiruzen calmly chose to spare Danzō, keeping this event a secret on the condition Danzō agreed to dedicate his life to protecting the village. Quickly recomposing himself, Danzō plainly stated that Hiruzen\\'s naive faith and mercy would be his end one day, to which the Third solemnly admitted may be so. Later, Danzō met with Orochimaru, telling him about the recent events and insisted they not meet for a while in fear Hiruzen might realise that Danzō and Orochimaru were behind the abduction of several Konoha citizens, to which the Sannin voiced that Hiruzen probably already has his suspicions.Naruto: Shippūden episode 351 However, Orochimaru did another implant onto Danzō taking Shin\\'s Sharingan-embedded arm and placing that, alongside some of Hashirama\\'s cells, onto that of Danzō\\'s.Naruto chapter 700+7, pages 12-13Danzō dispatches Kinoe to inform the clan.Later, Orochimaru\\'s sinister actions were discovered by the Third Hokage, forcing the Sannin to abandon Konoha. When Danzō learned of this, he knew Orochimaru would most likely go to their hideout with the Iburi clan. He sent Kinoe to inform the clan of Orochimaru\\'s arrival.Naruto: Shippūden episode 352 Danzō\\'s true goal was to have Kinoe capture Orochimaru, agreeing with Hiruzen that Orochimaru was too dangerous to let go rogue.Naruto: Shippūden episode 353 Over the years, Danzō continued to recruit new members of Root, including Torune Aburame of the Aburame clan. Three years after Orochimaru\\'s defection from the village, fearing that his stolen Sharingan eye would soon go blind from its overuse, Danzō sent Kinoe in an attempt to steal Kakashi\\'s Sharingan as a replacement.Naruto: Shippūden episode 355 Kinoe soon returned, having chosen to abandon his mission, much to Danzō\\'s fury. Reminding the young shinobi of his duties as a Root member, Kinoe insisted that they should not attack allies to Konoha, which Danzō proclaimed that Root\\'s only true allies is its own and exists only to protect Konoha itself. Unable to accept Danzō\\'s cold views, Kinoe spoke out, making his feelings known. Horrified to see how much Kinoe had changed, Danzō used his Sharingan to incapacitate Kinoe, having one of his men take Kinoe to have his cursed seal activated. As Danzō arrived at the operating room, he discovered Kakashi freeing Kinoe and retreating with him. Danzō and his men soon surrounded the duo. As Kinoe was still under Danzō\\'s command and Kakashi had trespassed on Root territory, Danzō had full authority to execute them. Before Danzō could act, the Third Hokage arrived, revealing that Kakashi was sent on his orders with a summoning request to be delivered to Danzō. No longer able to attack, Danzō faked ignorance of Hiruzen\\'s letter and called off his men. Hiruzen then spoke to Danzō about Kinoe and his abilities. Insisting that Konoha needed the Wood Release, Danzō agreed to hand over Kinoe to Hiruzen\\'s command but chose to not remove Kinoe\\'s cursed seal.Naruto: Shippūden episode 356 Three years later, a potential alliance between Konoha and the Land of Woods was made. While a team was sent to exchange secret scrolls with the Wood-nin as a sign of trust, a small team of Anbu, under Danzō\\'s command, was sent to observe under the suspicion that the Wood-nin would betray Konoha, in which case, the Anbu were ordered to kill them. Danzō chose Kakashi, still having high respect for his abilities, and the new recruit Danzō recommended into Anbu, Itachi Uchiha, as a two-man team for the mission.Naruto: Shippūden episode 357Two years later, when word reached Konoha\\'s leadership of a planned coup d\\'état by the Uchiha clan, Danzō took advantage of Itachi\\'s pacifist tendencies and convinced him to provide him and the other elders with information of the clan\\'s actions. When Shisui Uchiha, acknowledged for his unquestionable loyalty to Konohagakure, presented his plan of ceasing the Uchiha\\'s coup by casting Kotoamatsukami on his clansmen to the Council, Hiruzen agreed. Danzō, however, determined to protect the village in his own way and, believing that Shisui may try to manipulate him as well, stole the latter\\'s right eye, implanting it into his socket, with Shisui committing suicide sometime later.Naruto chapter 550, page 13 When Hiruzen decided to end the coup diplomatically, Danzō secretly met with Itachi and inveigled him into choosing to slaughter his clan by presenting him with the option of killing them and sparing his younger brother, Sasuke Uchiha or letting them go through with the coup and having them all killed as a result.Naruto chapter 590, pages 8-10 Itachi regretfully chose to kill the Uchiha clan. Hiruzen disbands Danzō\\'s organisation. Soon after the deed was done, Danzō told everyone that Itachi had done this out of his own will, having grown to despise his clan and even sought greater power by stealing Shisui\\'s eyes. While everyone else believed this fabricated story, Hiruzen saw through Danzō\\'s lie, voicing his disgust at Danzō\\'s actions. While trying to justify his actions by claiming it was for the village, Hiruzen retorted that the Uchiha were part of the village and never actually performed any treachery before their demise. No longer able to trust Danzō and his underhanded ways, Hiruzen immediately removed him from the Council and ordered for his Root division to be disbanded.Naruto Shippūden episode 359 Afterwards, Itachi\\'s clone, disguised as a Root member, approached Danzō and threatened to expose Konoha\\'s secrets to the other countries if Danzō ever harmed Sasuke.Naruto chapter 400, page 13 He met with Tobi around this time for reasons unknown.Naruto chapter 474, page 12 Over the years, despite his Root division being officially disbanded, Danzō continued to keep it secretly active.During the Konoha Crush, the Fourth Raikage insinuated that the invasion was a secret plot of Danzō with Akatsuki to dispose of both the Hiruzen and the Fourth Kazekage; however, it is unknown whether this actually happened. After seeing Hiruzen sacrifice himself using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal to defeat Orochimaru, Danzō decided to teach Sai how to use a powerful fūinjutsu, in order to prevent the same from happening to himself. During the training, Danzō noted that Sai could use \"emotional energy\" to bolster the power of the attack but warned the young man not to fall prey to his negative emotions.Naruto: Shippūden episode 284 Personality When he was younger, Danzō was a hotheaded and eager ninja with a strong desire to prove himself. He, after a long internal struggle, decided to volunteer himself to buy time for his teammates, though Hiruzen beat him to it.Naruto chapter 481, page 7 He often displayed jealousy towards Hiruzen, believing he was always one step ahead of him and feeling inferior to him. Danzō never used soft words like \"friend\", as he never wanted to lean on someone or be leaned on. As an adult, Danzō was a completely calm, cold and collected individual who did not allow his emotions to surface. Having fought many wars, and having looked up to his father\\'s and grandfather\\'s example of dying in battle, he came to disagree with other Hokage, believing that the interests of the village should be placed above all else, even ethics and morals. Danzō seemed to hate the previous Hokage\\'s beliefs stating those beliefs have destroyed the village after Pain\\'s assault on it, despite using the attack as an attempt to overthrow Tsunade and leaving its citizens in peril as well as being responsible for Nagato\\'s negative perceptions of Konoha, which lead to its destruction. According to Koharu Utatane, Danzō was very ambitious, but she also stated that all he ever did was for the sake of the village. In the anime, his desire to be a greater and stronger Hokage than Hiruzen made him even attempt to have Hiruzen assassinated in the belief that the Third Hokage had lost the capacity to effectively lead the village. An extremist, Danzō preferred to directly eliminate threats through assassination and execution rather than diplomacy and negotiation. However, he secretly worked closely with the international criminal Orochimaru in illegal experiments in order to increase his physical capabilities. Danzō possessed a fanatical and arbitrary adherence to the ideals of a shinobi, believing they must sacrifice absolutely everything for the village. However, Danzō hypocritically feared death, hiding this fear behind a belief that his survival was necessary for the sake of the shinobi world itself. He would only conquer this fear in the last moments of his life, boldly attempting to kill Sasuke and Tobi for the sake of his village and the entire shinobi world with his suicide, and destroying Shisui\\'s eye with his dying breath.After years in Hiruzen\\'s shadow, Danzō begins to actualize his goal of becoming Hokage.Despite his reputation as a militarist, Danzō ultimately sought peace for the ninja world, one he would achieve by uniting all shinobi forces under his control. As such, he sought the title of Hokage, waiting patiently for decades before an opportunity arose. Danzō\\'s pursuit of peace followed an ends justifies the means. As such, he had no remorse taking any immoral actions as long as he believed it would benefit Konoha. To that end, he worked in the shadows to ensure that this future came to fruition. He used Root to eliminate potential threats to Konohagakure with or without the consent of the Hokage and to further him along the path to achieving the position, as he believed he was best prepared for the \"necessary\" transition. Because of the nature of his actions, Danzō could not allow the details of what he had done to become public knowledge, and thus he branded members of Root with cursed seals to prevent them from revealing his secrets.Naruto chapter 452, page 8 Danzō also believed Konoha was strongest and most stable when the village had a target to focus its anger and hatred on. To this end, Danzō was key in stigmatising the Uchiha clan to the rest of the village and was the one to secretly leak out the knowledge that Naruto Uzumaki was the container of the Nine-Tailed Fox, ensuring the villagers would loathe him as a result.Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night Danzō also views the members of Root as expendable pawns and shows no remorse in having them perform duties that could result in permanent injury as shown in his ordering Fū to gouge out Ao\\'s Byakugan, despite the fact it would result in Fū losing his eye as well.Danzō is also treacherous by nature. Likewise, should an \"ally\" prove too capable for his comfort, Danzō will see to their elimination, as he attempted to do with both Nonō and Kabuto. Itachi also believed Danzō had no intention of honouring his promise of sparing Sasuke when he accepted the mission to kill his own clan and had to threaten to leak Konoha\\'s secrets to enemy villages and risk his own safety by returning to Konoha after Hiruzen\\'s death to protect Sasuke\\'s life. He was willing to do anything to further his physical and political powers, as shown in allowing himself to be experimented on with Hashirama\\'s cells by Orochimaru in order to gain the power to control a tailed beast and extend his use of Izanagi. He also broke international law by manipulating Mifune into making him supreme commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces. In his later years, Danzō had become somewhat delusional, believing that he would be able to change the Shinobi World, even though his actions at the Kage Summit lost him his credibility. Danzō also had no hesitation in stealing Shisui\\'s right eye in order to gain access to Kotoamatsukami despite his unquestionable loyalty to Konoha over his own clan and the fact he was a descendant of someone who had once been Danzō\\'s own comrade. Tobi deduced Danzō\\'s intent was to seize control of the Nine-Tails from Naruto by using his multiple Sharingan. Danzō is also shown to be extremely arrogant, as seen in his gloating during his final clash with Sasuke, believing he had won, and only he is capable of changing the entire world.Despite his self-righteous, amoral, and draconian methods, Danzō had a sense of nobility and dignity. He reprimanded Sasuke for his hatred and violence against Konoha, saying that it had wasted both the sacrifice of the Uchiha and Itachi\\'s own personal sacrifices.Naruto chapter 477, page 11 Like Hiruzen, he used the final moments of his life to help Konoha by trying to take Sasuke and Tobi with him. Despite his envy against the Third and their growing rivalry, he seemed to still care for his boyhood friendship with Hiruzen, reminiscing of his childhood memories with him and asking what he was to Hiruzen in his final moments.Naruto chapter 481, page 12 His fellow elders, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, held Danzō in high regard, and often took his advice when dealing with the politics of the village. It is unknown how much they knew about the full extent of his actions. Appearance Danzō\\'s full appearance.Danzō appeared as a frail, old man, who would normally walk with a cane. He had black, shaggy hair, and his right eye was bandaged — concealing a Sharingan underneath. Danzō has had an x-shaped scar on his chin ever since his youth. He wore a white shirt, with a black or dark grey robe over the top of it covering from his feet, to just over his right shoulder. The robe conceals his right arm which was bandaged, and covered with three large golden braces. The bandages hid an arm implanted with ten more Sharingan, originally belonging to Shin Uchiha, and the image of the First Hokage\\'s face protruding from his right shoulder where Hashirama\\'s cells were injected into his body.In his youth Danzō was quite handsome. He had the same shaggy hairstyle, except it was much longer, reaching eye level. He also wore the standard armour of that era, which covered his back, chest areas and lower abdomen while leaving his shoulders armourless. With this he wore a black outfit with matching wrist guards, a shuriken holster on his right upper leg, a pouch tied to his waist with bandages, and a Konoha forehead protector. At that time, he still has both of his normal brown eyes. He hid the right eye with bandages by the time he united with Hanzō in their attack against Akatsuki led by Yahiko, and wore a flak jacket. It was also shown that at least around the time of the Third Shinobi World War, he wore a black, hooded trench coat and high-length sandals. As a child, Danzō\\'s attire consisted of a short dark-green kimono tied with a sash.Naruto: Shippūden episode 211 During his meeting with Akatsuki, having adopted the name, \"Kanzō\", Danzō had long shaggy brown hair, an eyepatch over his right eye with a gas mask hanging around his neck as well as an Amegakure forehead protector. He also wore a dark coat with a shirt visible underneath as well as gloves around both his hands, a pouch on his right leg with bandages visible around both his legs and sandals. Abilities Danzō with the capability to control a tailed beast.As the leader of the Root and the Sixth Hokage Candidate, Danzō was an exceptionally powerful shinobi. Danzō\\'s skills were held in high regard by the elders Homura and Koharu as they considered him one of Konoha\\'s strongest ninja.Naruto chapter 488, page 14 Through skill and trickery, Danzō managed to combat the famed Shisui Uchiha and catch him off guard to steal his right eye. Kakashi expressed intense shock learning Danzō had been defeated single-handedly by Sasuke Uchiha. However, this defeat was partly attributed to his old age, and being unable to use Shisui Uchiha\\'s Mangekyō Sharingan. Despite all this, even with Sasuke\\'s excessive usage of his own Mangekyō Sharingan, Danzō still fought evenly with Sasuke throughout their battle, and dealt him a potentially fatal wound.Danzō was adept in both using and dispelling high-level genjutsu, even from powerful Sharingan-users like Sasuke. He also had some skill in taijutsu and a decent amount of physical strength, able to repel Karin with one kick.Naruto chapter 478, page 4 Danzō was also quite fast and agile as he was able to catch Sasuke off-guard and, in the anime, evade a large amount of debris falling on him. Additionally, Danzō was highly skilled in kenjutsu, as seen against the Prajñā Group'}"
